<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: </font> [d12 = 12]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair cups his chin in thought and then slumps with a sigh.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: This... situation is not ideal. But it is neither hopeless nor lost yet.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Well Vash, we shall accompany you in the beggining and then leave if you need something from this side. We shall also use your portal as a backdoor. I can attune it to search for Tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I will use this hour to prepare the circle and rest</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I too will make preparations.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair touches a metal vambrace and frowns.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Vash nods distractedly</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Fenmia, may I have the vial of Tekavaris blood?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia pulls the blood from his pack</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Here ya go. Can I help you with the circle?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I would apreciate some backup in case those trolls are upset</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia nods</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: You may wish to bring a peace offering...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Do you have something in mind?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well, I did mean to give this all to Hoot, but I think we had given him more than his share.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair takes out his dried wolf meat.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: That may do as a snack. Very well. I'll combine it with my own.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Leaves to go to the adventurers guild basement to retune the circle to search for Techavaris.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: and rest</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven and rest</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to no one): Heh. He must have been tired. Didn't even say anything as I split the party.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair speeds off to the shops to find any kind of armour that will do for now... But not before picking up that linothorax he had commissioned a day ago.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Persuasion [ADV] [DROPPED 5]</font> [g20+3 = 19]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos and Fenmia head back to the Adventurer's Guild where the very trolls you tied up earlier are scrambling to find their missing prisoners. You explain the situation to them and mollify their rage with copious quantities of wolf meat. They aren't pleased, but given that their charges are no more, they're willing to accept the meat in place of your corpses. You being the process of retuning the portal for Tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Meanwhile, Alastair retrieves his commisioned armor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Replacing the demon-link provided by Otto with the Tekavaris blood sample and retuning the mechanism proves to do the trick. After, you all meet up near Vash's army for a well-deserved rest.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair summons Mendel to assist him in finding a stable or anywhere with exotic--preferably flying--mounts.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to himself, because he lacks company): Or even a desperate druid or otherwise shapeshifter...</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Alastair spends an Artha for advantage</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Investigation [ADV] [DIS]</font> [d20+2 = 12]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair and Mendel ask around for flying mounts, or even shapeshifters willing to make themselves available. While Clockport is home to only one flying mount (the mayor's prize hippogriff), Alastair finds some visiting Druids who were in Clockport to protest an engineering convention. After some time he is able to persuade them to aid you.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Gafgarion: Well... we did not anticipate playing a direct role in any world-changing events while visiting your fair city. But it has been some time since our training has found use. I will warn you, we will not endanger our lives. We depart at the first sign of danger!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Fair enough. We are of the same mind.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Gafgarion: Well... we did not anticipate playing a direct role in any world-changing events while visiting your fair city. But it has been some time since our training has found use. I will warn you, we will not endanger our lives. We depart at the first sign of danger!</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): mistake above</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And I hope you won't find this affront to your ideals too offensive, but it just may save our lives and the Prime Material Plane...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair summons Mendel into the probe.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair hastily pawns his shield for a wooden one (?)</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Leaves all his metal behind</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair similarly discards most of his equipment and even his mace.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: Taking short rest.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: Taking short rest.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [RECOVERY]</font> [d8+1 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Recovery [2][HD-1] -&#62; [to Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [RECOVERY]</font> [d8+1 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Recovery [4][HD-1] -&#62; [to Fenmia] [STATUS: Healthy]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">After the hour is up and your preparations are finished, Vash explains the plan to everyone. On his command, the catapults will fire at the clocktower, destroying it and revealing the portal. His army has been programmed to rise into the air and follow him through the portal. Once on the other side, they will work to establish a beachhead at the first available opportunity. Vash has brought several drilling robots to assist in this effort. Once the beachhead is established, Vash has a plan that involves transforming the beachhead into a robot factory. He waves off the details of that part of the plan since they don't really concern you or the rest of his forces. Vash pauses to see if there are any questions.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: What if the portal should close behind us? Do we have a way back?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: What makes you think it will close? It has been open for several days now. Besides, once I establish a beachhead, I have plans to create my own portal through other means.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Just wondering. Very good. </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Given our aerial mobility, what ways do we have to signal or communicate? Flares?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: Communication would not do us much good. All the robots already have a program that they will use, regardless of the situation. I suppose it might be useful for us to be able to communicate. I suppose we would simply use our voices.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: What are we to do if you are critically injured?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: That depends. If I am injured after the beachhead has been established, there are medical robots that will see to my care, but if they are destroyed or unable to, I would appreciate being brought back through the portal. The robots are programmed to do the same for you should one of you fall.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: If the beachhead has not yet been established, then I suppose it depends on the circumstances. I will not lie to you. Casualties in war are unavoidable. I accept the risk.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Wonderful. That is all my questions.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I am ready.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: Excellent. Let us begin.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Vash confirms with the city guard that they are prepared to fire. Moments later, Vash raises his arm, and after a few seconds, lets it drop. A great rasping is heard as four catapults swing forward, hurling their enormous payloads at the clocktower. The tower shatters with a roar. A rain of stone and metal showers the army, but the bulk of the debris is thrown to the west onto a previously-cleared section of road, away from the army. The cloud of dust parts to reveal the buzzing portal and a small cloud of Tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Vash raises a wooden sign with green paint. His army whirls to life, leaping upwards using fueled jets that burn the ground beneath you. Smoke belches everywhere as Vash and his army head towards the portal.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair looks to the druids.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: The druids have already transformed themselves into Rocs. They are ready to Rol.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The druids have already transformed themselves into Rocs. They are ready to Rol.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair climbs aboard Gafgarion.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Climbs aboard</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven climbs aboard</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sends Mendel, hopeful that the probe will be able to outpace the army.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gafgarion leaps into the air, along with the other Rocs, bringing you with them.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia pats his symbol of helm and climbs onto a roc</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Animal Handling [+2]</font> [d20+4 = 13]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Animal Handling</font> [d20+3 = 11]<br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Animal Handling</font> [d20 = 1]<br />
<font color="#261A12">As you near the portal, Fenmia slips off his mount but manages to grab hold of the Roc's leg. It shrieks in pain and tumbles through the portal.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair and Aleios manage to keep a firm grip on their &#34;mounts&#34; as they sail smoothly through the portal among a storm of Vash's metal machines.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia lets out a yelp of fear</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Shouts and hoots. A fire in his eyes and his voice</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair is disturbed by how undisturbed by all this he is.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">On the other side, your first sensation is a hammering in your ears. The wind here is so incredibly strong that it's like a drumming in your head. You can barely see through the metal and the black, lightning-specked sky. Fenmia's bird is spiralling out of control towards the rocky ground. Vash's army is headed that way, in a slighly more controlled manner, but are being assaulted by Tekavaris that slam into them, throwing bits of acid and metal everywhere.</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Effect ['Spider Climb; (C)'] -&#62; [EXPIRED] [on Alastair]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia is rapidly approaching the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia attempts to climb back onto the Roc</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia manages to claw his way onto to the Roc's back, but the Roc's trajectory is out of control thanks to the wind. The two of you are spiralling towards the rocky ground, and the druid's wings are splayed back against it's body. The wings are likely broken.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: My apologies</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: (What are Alieos and Alastair doing in the meantime?)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia can't even hear his OWN voice over the howling wind drumming in his head. There is no noise at all, even when metal crashes into metal next to you.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia takes his staff, places it between the wings and uses it to steady them.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair winces through the pain throbbing in his head as he watches Fenmia and the other druid fall. He tries to bank Gafgarion to aid the falling pair.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Fenmia spends 1 Artha for Advantage</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Medicine [PROF]</font> [d20+2 = 21]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia throws together a &#34;splint&#34; out of his staff and some strips of cloth. He tucks it under the wings and slaps the cloth around, yanking tight. You see the Roc's head snap backwards in pain but you cannot hear the scream. With great effort, the roc stabalizes it's trajectory. As the roc hits the ground, the roc transforms back into a half-elf, throing you both roughly across the metallic, slate-gray rock.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">GM: +2</font> [d6+2 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Damage [3] -&#62; [to Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The druid rolls to a stop on the rock, unconcious. The wind is so strong that his body moves and rolls of its own accord.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven points to the body of the druid. And makes his way to save the druid.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia runs over and unties the druid and braces him from the wind</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair's roc doesn't seem to be heeding his command. You see the roc's eyes wide with fear. This is not what the driuds were expecting. They are trying to turn back towards the portal but are spending all their effort to just keep their wings beating at all.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Aleios's roc, similarly, does not seem to be able to heed commands.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair looks around to see how the Vash army is faring.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's very difficult to make an assessment of the battle. Some of the machines have indeed landed on the ground, but Vash is nowhere to be seen.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Perception [+1]</font> [d20+3 = 17]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Tries to fashion a parachute out od rope and a blanket</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair finally spots him, passed out but strapped into his machine. Two Tekavaris are attached to the machine and drops of acid are pouring out and being whisked away by the wind. The machine shudders and jerks, unable to make its way to its destination with the added weight.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Survival [PROF]</font> [d20+5 = 17]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos manages to throw together a parachute, ready to deploy when needed.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven tries to calm his mount. With an insperational petting</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Aleios spends 1 Artha for Advantage</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Performance [ADV] [DROPPED 7]</font> [g20+3 = 18]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The roc bucks beneath Alieos and it folds its wings and performs an unusual maneuver, throwing itself back towards the portal.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia checks to see if the druid is in stable condition</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Medicine [PROF]</font> [d20+2 = 8]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Jumps off the mount to allow it to go back through the portal and allow him to get to Fenmia</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia stabalizes the druid but the process takes longer than it should and the wind makes the operation tricky. Fenmia is able to staunch the bleeding but the druid will not have full use of his arms without magical intervention. A sheet of scrap metal slams into Fenmia while he's tending to the patient.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">GM: +2</font> [d6+2 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Damage [4] -&#62; [to Fenmia] [STATUS: Heavy]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos's parachute works surprisingly well, but it is very hard to guide it to Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Athletics</font> [d20-1 = 1]<br />
<font color="#261A12">The parachute wraps itself around Alieos as he descends, and he cannot see anything. He lands on solid ground with a thud. The wind immediately snaps him to the ground and begins to drag him across the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">GM: +2</font> [d6+2 = 7]<br />
<font color="#660066">Damage [7] -&#62; [to Alieos Belgiven] [STATUS: Heavy]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Oof!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos still can't see anything and is still being dragged across the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (shouts to Gafgarion): Down there! Can you bring us down to Vash?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair directs Mendel to defend Vash.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven fires an Eldritch Blast through the blanket to get out</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Absolutely zero sound carries. Alastair cannot even hear himself.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia starts dragging the druid towards the portal while trying to wave down an Ube</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The parachute flies free and into the air. Alieos can barely keep his eyes open against the wind but when he looks around, he cannot see the battle. All around him is rock, like a giant holy cheese, all run through with holes. Some holes are dark, and others have glimmers of lightning shining through.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia spots a cluster of Ubers at the designated beachhead spot. They are busy battling tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven realises he is stuck but probably safer than most. He can do nothing but rest, recover, and pray.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair tries patting on sides of Gafgarion's neck, seeing if he responds.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Mendel is able to harry one of the two Tekavaris, but when he concentrates on the other one, the first latches back on.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Performance</font> [d20 = 7]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Gafgarion is in a panic and not heeding any directions at all. He bucks at Alastairs touch,t rying to buck him off.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair directs Mendel to take Vash to the basecamp.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven attempts to patch himself up a bit</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Athletics [+2]</font> [d20+6 = 23]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Mendel is able to pluck Vash off of the machine and fly his unconcious body to the cluster of Ubers. Vash's machine is consumed by tekavaris and plummets out of the sky less than a minute later.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos listens to the wind howling outside and waits. After some time, he hears the pitter-patter of spider-like legs. A gaggle of three tekavaris crawl out of a hole nearby and pause. They don't seem to have eyes but they seem to be staring at Aleios.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair tries to hold onto Gafgarion harder, attempting to steer him closer to the ground so he can let go for a safer landing.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Hello you ugly things. You see I have no metal on me and I pose no threat.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Take me to your leader?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The tekavaris split up and slowly move so as to surround Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven stands and brushes himself off.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Well, if I am to perish then I shall do so fighting. But that would mean you must attack me first. I am a man of honor afterall</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia looks for something to throw at the Ubers/Tekavaris</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Athletics [+2]</font> [d20+6 = 12]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven has an idea. He attempts to use the power of command against one of the Tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair tries to hold on but is bucked into the air.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Command</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia throws whatever he finds</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Perception [PROF]</font> [d20+2 = 12]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia cannot possibly throw anything in this wind.  It immediately gets blown back into his face. He manages to narrowly dodge out of the way.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Bring me to your leader safely.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Abyssal]: [Translation] Bring me to your leader safely.</font><br />

<font color="#880000">Alastair goes limp, hoping that will lessen the damage. He also calls for Mendel to assist him, hopefully for a handhold to catch himself mid-fall or to at least intercept him to make the fall less... high.</font><br />
