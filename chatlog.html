<font color="##880000">Alastair is lacking anything useful, having left it all behind at the Mountriver estate.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Walks over to horse. Casually pats the horse.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: I have more rope!</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Fenmia hands rope to Alastair</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: But you need to tie it up... That thing grosses me out.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: String it up. I'm sure our benefactor would be interested in this. If it's indeed another targeted act from the... Bulgars, was it?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair makes an earnest attempt with the rope...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: hmmm. We need to learn more about them first</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alastair: The Bulgars?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair surrpetitiously looks about for a convenient box, crate, or barrel to stick the &#34;thing&#34; inside of.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You find a handy crate.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair crates the thing.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven (enthusiasticly): You tie as well as you fight. Well done</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Appreciated. Now then, shall we complete the delivery mission?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Quite right</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Let us continue</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">The owner beckons over several young lads to unload the cart as he speaks with you.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair shakes his head.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Forgive me my naivete. I forgot what kind of town this was.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: City Alastair..</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common] (nodding sagely): Things sure have changed in the last year.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven (intrigued): Really? What big changes have you seen?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common]: Well, I'm grateful for the help guarding it, though it feels to me like Vash should question what the point of such an invention is if it is to be guarded.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common]: Out-of-town mercenaries, eh? Well, *smacks the Uber hard*, take this thing for example. Ever since Vash down the street set up shop, he's been rpoducing all kinds of miracles. And charging a price for 'em too. Doesn't give the Guild its cut, either, so of course they are turning his own weapons against him.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Think of it like teething issues. Dervin has jelous rivals.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair cups his chin.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Intriguing.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Alieos's last point): The concept is sound enough. We should perhaps suggest the addition of some defensive armaments, though. It is rather a marvel in its own right.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I'm new here. Who's Vash? How is the guild turning his own inventions against him</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: What kind of new marvels?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common]: He's just some rich fella with a lot of weird ideas. Dunno much about him 'cept all this metal shit around here was bought from him. His shop is up Main Street, right near the south gate in Milkend.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thanks</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common]: As for marvels, well, your Uber is an example. Most stores also have a trash compatter or whatever they're called. Made the city much cleaner, I'll give 'im that. Also makes these small trinkets you put on the hand that tells the time so's you know if it's dinner time without looking up at the Cracked One.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Trash compatter? You mean those large box-like devices outside of the shops? Hm, I was wondering what those devices were.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common]: Them's the ones. Bought one meself after the council fined me for the smell. Weren't a problem 'fore, but now with the city smelling like a daisy my place stood out. Bad for business to stand out.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Wow neat! Why's the clock tower called the Cracked One? Sounds like a god</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Restaurant Owner [Common] (laughing): Perhaps it is, eh? Who's to say? It's too dark to see now but them walls are all veined with cracks the size of attic doors. That's how Vash got here in the first place, city hired him to repair the thing. He said it was fine but set up shop right after!</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Your man at the pub believes that this is the work of the Thieves Guild.</font><br />

<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Manservant [Common]: Thieves' Guild? Those dolts are too busy fighting amongst themselves to be able to pull off a stunt like this. Besides, we pay their dues and are never late.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I see.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Manservant [Common] (to Fenmia): Why, they are our oath-sworn enemies. Who else would dare attack our guard patrols? Who else would ahve the capabilities to hire wizards?</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alastair sees a package on a table outside his room containing the ingredients necessary to summon Mendel, as well a purse containing 50 gold coins.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair chuckles slightly and immediately begins the ritual.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia Goes to banquet hall</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">In the banquet hall, Dervin is eating his breakfast, and upon seeing you orders the servants to bring you a plate.</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Dervin nods and returns to his food.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: Oh... Well I slept fine, but we ran into another one of those things last night.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Dervin looks up</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dervin: Indeed?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Greatings Dervin! A pleasure to see you. I think you will be happy to know we have made some progress.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: You didnt hear already?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia gestures toward Alieos</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dervin: My manservant mentioned some trouble but said you had handled it. I've been busy trying to mount our WallBreaker (tm). The instructions are very unclear.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dervin: Progress is good! Tell me, what must we do next?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: Maybe Alastair could help you with the instructions? He's very smart you know</font><br />

<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven (luaghing): You are so keen my friend! By days end I may be able to tell you. For now, we have a suspicious location to investigate. It's were those creatures are coming from!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dervin: If you have time, it would be appreciated!Don't want to accidentally configure it to fire in the wrong direction! HAHAH!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Dervin nods sagely, seeming to already be thinking about battle formations</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Gnomish]: [Translation] I meant Alastair... Oh well</font><br />
<font color="##000000">I meant Alastair... Oh well</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia]</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">An hour later, with a magic bang, Mendel the owl appears once again before Alastair</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Good to have you back, Mendel.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: *owl noises*</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair rings the bell for servant assistance.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Manservant appears with a far less magical bang.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Manservant bows</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): brb bathroom</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Attend me, if you would.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair indicates his plate armour.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Manservant snaps his fingers. A dwarf runs over and begins helping you with your armor.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair joins Fenmia and Aleios in the dining hall. As he is arriving, Dervin is getting up to return to the business at hand. He greets Alastair warmly and calls for a fresh plate, which arrives soon.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia waves at Alastair</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (greeting the other two): Good morning, gentlemen. I trust in particular order that it's Vash and the Bulgars today?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: (in *no* particular order)</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): Back</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: Thinks so! Dervin was telling us that he's building a Wallbreaker (tm)  whatever that is</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Sounds... devastating.</font><br />

<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Yes, that's what I was thinking</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Do we even know where the Bulgar estate is?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I'll let you all investigate Vash while I do some research on the Bell Tower.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'd advise against.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia slaps head</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: I knew we forgot to ask hiim something</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: But if I may suggest another item to our list.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Perhaps we can do both together. We have plenty of time</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: Where to first?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven finishes eating</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: What's closest?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: As much as I'd like to visit the library first, I think we may have to see the Bulgars. Before some unnecessary bloodshed.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: ...Or wallbreaking.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Yes. Good point</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Was having a look at yesterday's... assailant worth a second glance?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair wolfs down his breakfast with rabid hunger.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair daintily dabs the corners of his mouth with a napkin.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven leaves his dish and pushes from  the table.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: Could be but where did they take it?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia, Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The table rocks and comes crashing down from Aleios pushing it!!! Just kidding.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: The study again perhaps?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ehhhh. What more can we gain from it. We just don't have the knowledge to understand, I think.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'd like to see if we can do another extraction if we could.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Taking the sample back to Dervin's office, you cut into it like the other one and find similar results. You extract the acid into a new vial.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Very well.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven nods</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Asking around, you quickly learn the location of the Bulgers. There are also several offers made to accompany you, and a rapid unclicking of safety catches. One guard lowers his battle visor. The Bulger's house is directly across the small park that decorates the space in front of the Mountriver manor.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (remarks on the closeness): Should we perhaps wave a flag of non-aggression before they shoot us full of bolts as we cross the park?</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Alastair fashions a display of non-aggression with a procured table cloth and a torch.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm. I *think* this gets the point across.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Shall we then?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: motions his arm onwards</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia nods</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair takes his shield out, knowing how this will probably go.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: *Now* I'm ready.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: (Owl noises.)</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You raise your makeshift peace plag and head towards the the entrance to the Bergers, which is almost across the street from the Mountriver HQ. You approach a makeshift barricade where several guards with crossbows eye you suspiciously. Their crossbows are pointed at you.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Alieos): You're on.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair casts Guidance on Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I greet your great house as Alieos Belgiven. My friends and I only wish a short parley with your masters.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven with great elegance and respect</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Persuasion [ +4]</font> [d20+7 = 13]<br />
<font color="##660066">Guard: </font> [1d20+1 = 19]<br />
<font color="##000066">Guard: A Mountriver trick if I've ever seen one! You think I was born yesterday? You didn't even bother with the truce-phrase! Get 'em outta here boys.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">A crossbow bolt slams into the cobblestones next to Alastair's feet</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] History [PROF]</font> [d20+4 = 10]<br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair clears his throat.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to the the guard): If you would give us a few moments.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair jerks his neck to signal that they should withdraw momentarily.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: Readies himself just in case.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">'Vzaretskiy' disconnected</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia withdraws with Alastair</font><br />
<font color="##660066">'Vzaretskiy' connected</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel takes off and circles the courtyard.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: withdraws</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The Guards laugh and shoot off a few celebratory bolts for having figured out your &#34;ruse.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Okay... what if we ask derbin for the phrase?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Suppose he would be the person to ask. Although I wonder if the footman would be in the know.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: didn't you say that historically only the leaders knew the phrase?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair returns to the Mountriver side. Rather sheepishly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: The footman would hardly leave the master's side. But I suppose in this circumstance we ought to do this with the lord's consent.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Are we even representing Dervin? Technically we are just travelers looking for councel, no?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Well, we are admittedly prospective &#34;business associates&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia shrugs</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: That is a fair point... I suppose I understand their hesitation.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: That's a good point Fenmia. I would answer that with a question. Have we not been spotted in and around Dervans person for some time now? These madmen would surely assume we represent Durvin</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Footman: Greetings again. I hope your stay has been pleasant.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Greatings Legman! Is Dervin free for a moment? He knows we wish to talk with the Burgers but we can't without their kinky safewords</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: lol Legman</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Footman: He is not free, though I suppose he would not mind speaking with you. But I doubt you will have any success getting a truce-phrase from him. This early in the conflict, he will feel it is a sign of weakness.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: ah.. Good point. </font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I wouldn't want to besperch his name.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hmp. I suppose we are forced to do this as those of our profession are expected...</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sighs deeply and slumps.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Alieos): Don't suppose you have Windwall, do you?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia looks at Alieos curiously</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven optimistcly You are not one to be discoraged so quickly Alastair! Remember we fought and killed a Banshee! I danced a demon into inacting peace! We can do anything!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: But... that was killing monsters. *This* is politics.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven [Common] (wisley): and sarcastically Are they not the same?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair opens his mouth to say something, but then pauses thoughtfully.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Only figuratively.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: Message</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven starts to plan</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Message</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Investigation [ +4]</font> [d20+6 = 15]<br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair dives into the House Mountriver tomes for information about their conflict with the Bergers.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Investigating the history of Bergers, Alastair discovers some interesting information:</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Footman, could you show me where to fill this water skin?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">1. The Bergers and Mountriver clans are from the same dwarven city: Hollowhome.&#10;2. They were both part of the same ruling class there. At the time, they were political royal&#10;houses, though this appears to have changed.&#10;3. They were generally considered allies during the Hollowhome period. They were considered to be&#10;particularly adept at a form of political warfare known as kanly. This &#34;war&#34; seems to be the modern&#10;version of that old &#34;game.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Footman: Why, of course.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The footman guides you to a large kitchen area with several dwarves working on making rations.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia fills water skin</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Thank you!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Footman nods politely</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia takes a pinch of the Sparkly Beige powder and mixes it into his water pouch and sips to test the taste.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair (repeats) 'Kanly'. Like a vendetta?</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (repeats): 'Kanly'. Like a vendetta?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia sees a brief, ghostly vision of a stage and a waiting audience.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia shakes head clear and puts water skin away.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair strokes his chin.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Or is this all... just actually a game?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sighs and neatly returns the books to rejoin the others.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (&#34;to): dwarves&#34; Whatcha makin?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Cook (to Fenmia): Mili'try rations. Anchovies mostly. But I put a little rum in mine. *winks*</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Just thinking ahead, I wonder if this has to do with Dervin's father going missing a month ago</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia smiles</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I don't doubt that could be a part of it. But frankly I'm wondering if we're just blundering into the local passtime.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And if that's the case, how would we insinuate ourselves into the game?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Sounds good. Mind if I take some?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia reaches for rations</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Cook (shrugs, and looks around): Sure.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I say we find a minstrel and ask about this</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair brightens up.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The cook slides a ration Fenmia's way.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I did want to go back to the pub...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Thanks! Names Fenmia by the way</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia waves and rejoins group</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven [Common] (winking): I've always liked good natured scoundrels like you.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: But I also wanted to check in with the Adventurer's Guild as well. And I wonder if this &#34;Vash&#34; we've heard about would be able to offer any outsider insights about the families.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Cook: I'm Kuft. *offer greassy hand*</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia stops and shakes hand</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Well met!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia bows and takes his leave</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Cook gets back to work</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Well, what do you say about going to the pub Fenmia?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (adds): For intel. And ale.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: or  Vash?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: It may still be to early for the pug</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I'm in!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Haven't you heard of elevenses?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Do Minstrels play durring elevenses?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Oh are there halflings here?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: One way to find out Alieous. Lets go!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: leaves to the pub</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair follows.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair also sends a command to Mendel to scout for any wandering minstrels that may be about town.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: (Owl noises.)</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia follows almost dancing</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: eyes Fenmia suspiciously, wondering if he enjoys drinking too much.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Mendel: [SKILL] Perception</font> [d20+1 = 9]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (considers): I'd like to think that the local &#34;local&#34; would be a good starting point.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Where do you think the guards of each respective house go to drink?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Probably a guard pub, if I'm honest.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: or we can go highend as political figures might frequent thopse</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: In that regard it may be more prudent to go directly to the source or perhaps a sommelier.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'd think that those in power would prefer the closed doors of a private club or their own storeroom than somewhere where someone could listen to their loosened lips.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: A sommelier is a good idea. How do we loosen their lips?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: By overplaying our relationship with House Mountriver. Naturally.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Alright. So we should go to a Mountriver favored place</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Investigation [ +3]</font> [d20+5 = 24]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Investigation [PROF] [ +4]</font> [d20+7 = 25]<br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Investigation [ +2]</font> [d20+1 = 4]<br />
<font color="##261A12">After some questioning and searching, you find out that a wmall wooden house with apparently no door is actually the private club that many of the political elites frequent. You eventually find the entrance (it is a trapdoor on the ground that you mistook for a drainage ditch) and head inside. There is an off-duty Mountriver dwarf whi vouches for you at the door. Once inside, you are enveloped in a thick smoke that smells vaguely of coal. There is a roulette table made of a stone wheel that makes a grinding noise as it spins. The enormous bar is set low, down a flight of stairs, like descending into a pit. There is no open seating and all the seats are in partitioned dividers, even at the bar itself.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (mutters): Why do I feel underdressed...</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: flurry of blows</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Calm down, man.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Woah, my bad!</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: </font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair observes the current occupants.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">It's hard to see into all the partitions but the place seems pretty quiet. The roulette table seems to be the focal point at the moment. There is a large metal contraption at one side and a gaggle of dwarves hooting and placing bets.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Additionally, from your vantage point you spot a lone regal-looking dwarf sitting in a booth at the a bar-partition</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: Looks for a sommelier</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common]: </font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia [Common] [Common]: </font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You also spot a young half-elf near the entrance who looks out of place. She holds a sign that reads &#34;Private Messaging Service&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">It looks like this isn't really a &#34;wine place.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: The half-elf looks like a great person to talk to</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair shrugs helplessly and then positions himself at a vacant stall facing the bar.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Do you mind grabing me a drink while I talk with her?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: If you don't mind something... down the beaten path.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (corrects): Strike that. *Not* down the beaten path.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: That is to say &#34;off&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven hesitantly Sounds ominous but..Sure!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair hears a clanking sound as a trapdoor opens behind the bar. A young, sharply-dressed dwarf emerges, bows to him, and drops a small plate with a pickled egg in front of him.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: What can I getcha?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair immediately chomps the picked egg in half.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (muffled): Have you any barleywine?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Of course. A moment, milord.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: One for me too please!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: walks over to the half-elf</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">He engages a large brass lever. You hear an even louder clanking as suddenly a brass contraption drops from the ceiling. The bartender sighs and presses several buttons. A glass drops onto the bar. Then the machine begins to fizz loudsly. After several seconds of this, the machine goes silent. The bartender looks up at you blankly.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: My apologies. Give me a moment.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia stares in amazement of the contraption</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The bartender jumps up, grabs the machine, drags it down until with some sparks and scraping noises, it topples to the ground. He bartender claps his hands and extracts a bottle from the top of the machine. He kicks the machine aside and pours you half a glass-full.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">He then pours another for Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Should I start a tab, milord?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Thank you. Might you be able to recommend something... strange for my mage friend over there?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair jerks his neck in Alieos' direction.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And yes, please. If you would.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender (chortling): Does milord mean something *truly* special for our honored guest the mage?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair spreads his hands.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Suddenly feels his own ghost tap his shoulder in warning</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Merely... Unusual.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender (leaning in to whisper): I am asking milord if he wishes to dispose of the mage...?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair &#34;considers&#34; for a moment.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Flashes a wicked smile and a wink at Alastair. He sure knows me.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Deception [ +3]</font> [d20+3 = 13]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: &#34;Not today.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Bartender (looking aghast) Of course not. I shall &#34;whip something up&#34; immediately.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The bartender picks a black bottle from within the machine. He pours a finger of a smoky, dark liquid.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Hello. I am Alieos Belgiven. A friend and business accociate of Dervins. May I have a moment of your time?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: This is an ancient brew from the fatherland. At least 200 years old, it was fermented over a bed of glitter-coals, then buried in slate dust for a century. I am certain the mage has never tasted anything like it.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Messenger: Hiya. Who's the message recipient?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I may or may not have a message to send. But I do have a question.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Am I to understand that this libation was brewed in Hollowhome?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Messenger (rolling her eyes): For those kinds of services, you need to talk to the bartender. I'm strictly messaging contracting services only.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Oh, no, it's county of origin is Gherkeren, not Hollowhome. It's a figure of speech, milord. Don't mean to imply that. We'd not joke about such a thing.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (disappointed): Very well. I'm sure the gentleman will richly appreciate the art and history of it.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven [Common] (quite snarl): Do not roll your eyes at me girl. I can rip them out with a thought or simply ask dervin to repay his debt to me by putting you in a hole filled with horrors for a hundred years</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair picks up his tankard and reaches around his partition to clink his with Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Intimidation [PROF]</font> [d20+5 = 9]<br />
<font color="##660066">Bartender: </font> [d20-1 = 3]<br />
<font color="##261A12">The half-elf takes a step back, fear in her eyes</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Messenger (fearfully): Of course, sir. I... I will meet you in one of the private rooms momentarily.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">She scurries away towards the back.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: Follows</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia raises tankard to Alastair</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): I don't follow yet</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair clinks his tankard against Fenmia's</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Alieos): ) I hope you didn't just miscommunicate that you were propositioning that girl.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair stares.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: walks over to Fenmia and Alastair. Picks up his drink. Winks .toasts them and walks to the room.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: No</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Fenmia): He didn't say no.</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alastair): Forget I said that.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Narrator: He did miscommunicate that he was propositioning that girl.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: closes his eyes</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Please put your clothes back on</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: there has been a misunderstanding</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I DID simply want to ask you a few questions</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I got angry because I thought you were dismissing my inquiry in a very rude fashion.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Messenger: Oh... Damn. I'm sorry. You just... you snapped at me back there, and I assumed.... Well, I should tell you that I already pulled the panic cord.... I'm really sorry.... *pointing to a discreet cord hanging above the bed*</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Meanwhile, in the main room, Alastair and Fenmia see four burly dwarves emerge from trapdoors behind the bar and head towards wherever Aleios went. They're carrying clubs.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair decides to ignore them.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: I see you work in subtle ways, milord.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: They'll make short work of him.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Lightly hopped, and do I detect a faint note of... coriander?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Milord has a fine palette</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: You already pulled the panic cord? Arathis save her. Well, let's do this.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (to Alastair in a hushed tone): Maybe we should check on Alieos, no?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Might I interest you in this barleywine that was bottled for the Lord of Halls?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm, speak of its flavour profile?</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Fenmia): Give them a moment. I have a feeling that all six of them will feel very silly in about thirty seconds.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: gently sips his drink. tasting everything he can. noting to memory. rolls up his sleaves and then:</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Slightly bready with a hint of toffee on the finish. Very nuanced malt profile.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia shrugs</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Prestidigitation</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Aleios glances around for doors, spotting the one at the back in addition to the one he came from.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I'm gonna check out the action over there!</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (considers): Hm, maybe after lunch. Tell me, with whose house would that ale and this one be most popular?</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Fenmia): Give a yelp if you require assistance.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia takes a gulp of barleywine and stands up</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Fenmia heads towards the group of betting dwarves</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bartender: Why, you know your brews, milord! This here is the favored drink of Lord Berger himself. In fact, we only stock it for him. Special delivery every week, on a schedule and everything. Hah!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: Waits for the door he entered from to open. Winks at the half-elf and says &#34;Here's to misunderstandings and a show!&#34;then Misty Steps back to his table.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Misty Step</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia approaches the roulette table. The dwarves there are betting on the contraption sitting in front of the table. Right now, one of the betting dwarves has placed a pile of stone chips on red and the audience is cheering as the wheel spins.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Stealth [ADV] [DROPPED 6]</font> [g20+1 = 10]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Aleios lands with a light thud. The guards do not hear him.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: sits</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (deadpan): Oh no. My cunning plan.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Soooo I had a fun time.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Bartender glances slowly at Alastair.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia bumps the closest dwarve spilling a bit of wine in the process</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: How do I get in on this?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: Notices the game</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Without so much as a glance, the dwarf immediately reacts to the shove with a punch.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (nonplussed): One of Lord Berger's choice for the mage.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: I meant Alieos notices Alastairs glance and the game he was playing</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: [SAVE] Dexterity</font> [d20+5 = 14]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Missed me</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Drunk Dwarf: Watch yerself, arse--- woah. Damn, did y'all see this fella whip himself like a damn rubber hose?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia smiles</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven acting Alastair you Manged cat. Good try. I'll get you back for that!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Drunk Dwarf rubs his arm sheepishly and explains that you can place a bet with the croupier.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: But thanks for the drink!</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Bartender nods quickly and shrugs, pouring Aleious a finger of the beer.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: So I learned nothing thanks to a very large misunderstanding</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: It may yet bear fruit.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: Bartender. If you haven't tried the last drink I had you should! It was the greatest drink I have ever had!</font><br />
<font color="##660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): I need to have Alieos roll for knowning the notes of the drink he had.</font><br />

<font color="##000066">Drunk Dwarf (to Fenmia): So, you a pit fighter or somethin'? Don't look it</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Just lucky I guess... Good thing you didn't connect or I may be laid out. </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Now to test my luck again!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven (to Alastair) What do I have to be sorry about? I guess I'm sorry for the world she must live in that causes her to assume such things.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Well, I'm thankful you have at least *that* much insight, such as it is.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: my insight works best within hindsight</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: unfortunatly</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Croupier: You must purchase tablets or pebbles. I'll be happy to put it on your account, which is....?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: This foray has been informative in ways that I'm afraid may be unrelated to what brought us here. After our friend is finished at the table I think we ought to move on.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Yes. To Vas perhaps?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Vash</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: Narrator: He means Vash</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Um, I'm with the Bergers.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Aye, definitely an option. I would also like to see what remains of the Adventurer's Guild as well.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good idea</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Croupier: Of course. Minimum bet is 50 pebbles. A pebble is worth one minted gold coin with any accepted stamp. How many pebbles would you like to purchase?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Don't suppose you'd like to try your luck again rubbing elbows with the lords and ladies?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Also I'm still unclear on what your actual intentions with that girl were.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Well, she stands in the middle of an establishment filled with Mountainriver affiliates. She might have heard something about the confict between Mountainriver and the Burges.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Not a bad notion.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: That's what I thought. But then came the misunderstanding...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm. I wonder if I should perhaps clarify the misunderstanding.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair fingers his holy symbol.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Perhaps *this* will say something about my intentions.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: You can try that..</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm. Let's not be hasty.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to the Barman): I beg your pardon. About that girl. What service does she provide?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: She sends messages</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: What exactly does that mean?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I'll take one hundred pebbles. Just a taste, for now.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Croupier: Of course, sir.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Croupier reaches under the table, scribbles a note in a ledger, and deposits a small stack of round stone discs in front of you in various denominations.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: You take some parchment, write something, put it in an envelope, seal it, tell her where you want it sent and pass the envelope over</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: and pay her</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman: Her? Ack, she's a fixer. Wish we didn't have to tolerate them. Apologies, sirs.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (knowingly): Ho-ho.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Croupier: Would you like to place a bet now, sir?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: That may come in handy later... Though I suppose I should mend that rickety bridge.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven (to Alastair): What's a fixer? I'm not familiar with that term.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Croupier: I would be happy to place a bet for you, if you wish.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: They... &#34;facilitate&#34; things.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Connect you with the right people.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ah</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman (nodding): Yeah, they, you know, send a message.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ah</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Oh, yes please. </font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia looks at the roulette wheel to try and sort out the best strategy</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair stands.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Right. Kindly watch my kit.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair lays down his shield and mace, leaning them down against the foot of the bar.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven nods</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven sips his bearlywine</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia thinks back to his childhood playing 3 cup monte for tips</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Sleight of Hand</font> [d20+3 = 16]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: 50 on 13-16 my goodd sir!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Croupier lays your pebbles down on the betting table amid some light jeering about the size of your bet.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Croupier spins the metal wheel.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: </font> [d20 = 8]<br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: </font> [d20 = 17]<br />
<font color="##261A12">The wheel stops at 17. Unlucky!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Croupier sweeps the pebbles off the table. Everyone loses.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia shakes his head and looks at the dwarf from before</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks about the establishment, trying to ascertain the whereabouts of that fixer girl.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: What number do you like my friend?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Drunk Dwarf: Me? I'm just a nobody. Here guarding the city manager. *points to dwarf nearby* Wouldn't risk my hard-earned cash, you know?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair can barely make out some voices coming from the back room area that Aleios had emerged from.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair unsummons Mendell from his search and resummons him onto his shoulder.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: (Owl noises).</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sends Mendell out to investigate as stealthily as possible.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 1]<br />
<font color="##660066">Drunk Dwarf: </font> [d20 = 2]<br />
<font color="##660066">Mendel: [SKILL] Stealth [ +1]</font> [d20+2 = 15]<br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair closes his eyes and wargs.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven makes faces at alastair</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Well then... I propose a trade of sorts. How's about you gamble some of my hard earned money and you keep the winnings. In return, you introduce my friends to your boss.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia smiles and gestures towards remaining pebbles</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel quietly hops from crack to crack in the stone until he's in the hallway behind the bar, peering through the open doorway. Inside are the four guards and the half elf. The guards are arguing with the half-elf. They seem annoyed that she pulled the panic cord as a joke, or so they think. She's not even supposed to back here, they say.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Persuasion</font> [d20+2 = 14]<br />
<font color="##880000">Drunk Dwarf considers for a moment, then nods.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Drunk Dwarf: Don't see why not! He's a public officer after all!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair opens his eyes and makes for the back room at a calm and nonchalant pace.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Lead Bouncer turns as Alastair approaches</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lead Bouncer: Sir, this room is occupied. Bar business.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Drunk Dwarf takes the money, puts it all on 20.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Drunk Dwarf: </font> [d20 = 13]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Alas! 13!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I beg your pardon, but I believe I have business with the young lady behind there.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair holds up his holy symbol.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Drunk Dwarf shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Mountainriver business, if you please.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Drunk Dwarf: Oh well. That was about as fun as I thought it would be, which is not much. Well, let me know when you're ready and I'll make the introduction.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Persuasion [ +2]</font> [d20+2 = 20]<br />
<font color="##000066">Lead Bouncer: Uhhh, well. She's a bit opf a prankster, she is. She ain't supposed to be back here. Of course, sir, you are free to talk with her if you wish, but, uh, just talk, yeah? She ain't got no license. For anything else besides talk, I mean.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Of course.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Lead Bouncer seems unsure but shrugs and waves the other bouncers out, leaving the door open behind him. He scowls at the half-elf</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: Thanks for that, sir. I don't recognize you from the Mountriver estate. New?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair motions for Mendell to keep watch.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We are acquaintainces of the young master. And I apologize for the misunderstanding with my associate earlier. I do hope that we have not caused you undo trouble. You are unharmed?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf (standing up, dusting herself off, and standing up striaght): I'm fine. Your associate is a confused oaf. If you wish to send a message, let me know. Otherwise, I have business to attend to.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Actually, it was that business that I wished to inquire. I would wonder if you would have any inroads with House Berger. Bit of an impasse at the moment. As prospective business associates with House Mountriver, we wondered if we would perhaps be able to have a counterbid with the Bergers.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven walks up to Fenmia</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I see you've won the estableshment!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven claps Fenmia on the back</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Any news?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: No counter-bid necessary. They don't hire me. Say I'm too cheap, they use that Hawker crew. *spits* Those assholes couldn't hit a target if it was hanging around their necks.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Alieos! We've made a friend... What is your name again?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: I did hear they're at war with the Mountrivers though. Is that what this is about? I'll give you a special rate if you want me to send a message to the Hawkers. *spits again*</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven looks for a tag with the initials NPC</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Drunk Dwarf: Me? I'm Frawd Knurd, at your service. Well, not really, technically occupied at the present.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm, was hoping for a direct message to the man himself, actually. We came to Clockport to establish an exclusive trade franchise with the young master of House Mountriver. Given the state of things, I thought that maybe the Bergers would have more to offer instead; if only for us to bring that fact to the bargaining table.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Please to meet you Frawd Knurd</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I also assume that this 'kanly' business is of the everyday sort. Am I incorrect?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Frawd is going to introduce us to the town manager. We should get Alastair before speaking to him  though.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good idea. Let us wait then</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: I see. That's doable, but the rate is high. What kind of message do you think will make your point, exactly? Usually these types of deals just call for a poisoned meal to be snuck in or something. The snoopers will catch it and you just stick a note to the bottom of the plate or something. Does that work?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Half Elf wishes she didn't say &#34;or something&#34; as often, or something.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And what is the rate?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: As to the kanly, yeah, this is pretty typical. Last war lasted three days, about two weeks ago. I think the Goggers ended up negotiating a better deal on timber? I helped on that one too, sent a message to the guard captain.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: For what I just described, standard poisoned meal, I can do 100 gold pieces, since you're first-time customers.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair thinks for a moment.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: How's the local palate for cinnamon?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf (confused): Huh?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair half-shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: As I said. Do the nobles of this town--much less House Berger--have a taste for the spice?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf: I've got no idea. I'm not even sure I know what that is. Some sort of cooking thing? Yeah, merchants love that kind of thing. I'm just a messenger, I eat potatoes and lichen.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: As for the job, I will need to discuss the matter with my comrades. That being said... this conversation never happened, yes?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf (nodding): Right. Good. If you need to get in touch, either return here between sunrise and midday, or else leave a note at [address in Clockport]</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Have a name, miss? An amusing sobriquet will do.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf (proudly): I'm the Lone Wolf around here.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Very good. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Lone Wolf.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Half Elf (heading for the door): Same. Good day.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair gives a small salute as he retreats back into the tavern proper.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks for Fenmia and Alieos to rejoin them.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven waves Alastair over</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Lone Wolf stalks past the bar without looking around and heads for the exit. The bouncers discreetly try to pull her aside but she twists out of the their grasp, punches one in the chest and jumps thorugh the trapdoor.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia makes introductions and tells Alastair of the arrangement</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair relates what he's been up to.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I hope this brand of meddling doesn't become a habit.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: hmmm very wise</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I kinda like creating a bit of chaos. It makes for an intersting life</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'm already beginning to miss our simpler times of strategizing how to kill specters of abbottesses.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Abbesses?</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: Narrator: *shrugs*</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Or what to do about stone golems?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair grunts.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Dungeons I do *not* miss.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We were just about to head over to talk with the Town Manager</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Ah, just a moment.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair motions for Mendel.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven hides his suprise</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel swoops from his perch and stands on Alastair's stool at the bar.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I saw Mendel the whole time</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: (Owl noises.)</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Right. Ready.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Deception [PROF]</font> [d20+5 = 9]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Shall we Fenmia?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Lets! Frawd?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Frawd Knurd: It's time? Yeah, okay. *taps the nearby dwarf on the shoulder* Sir, someone here to see you.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: We're not at the office, Knurd! How much have you had to drink, you goat?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: He looks more like a Taog to me</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Frawd Knurd: At least three tankards, but that's besides the point. They have an appointment!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Well, that's rather inconvenient. We'll discuss this later, Knurd. *turns to you* How may I be of assistance, sirs...? </font><br />
<font color="##880000">City Manager clearly leading you to say what house you are from</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We are here as friends and business accoiciates of Durbin Mountianriver. I am Alieos Belgiven, this is Fenmia, and this is Alastair. I am pleased to meet you. I was curious to know if you know of the reason behind this war between Mountainriver and the Burges?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Persuasion [ +4]</font> [d20+7 = 16]<br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: I see. I'm not sure I understand the question. The current war? Probably just a disagreement about lumber prices. The Goggegberg clan recently got the Bergers to lower the price and I'm guessing Dervin wants the same rate. It'll peter out by the end of the day, mark my words. Just stay away from Dust street until then, I suppose.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Have they not historically always been allies?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager (confused): Yes, of course. I'm sorry, sir, did you not say you are Dervin's associates? I feel I am missing the.... thrust of this line of questioning.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair raises a hand.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: If I may interject Your... Honour? The young master made some worrying remarks prior to the current escalation of conflict between Mountriver and Berger estates. Which is to say nothing of the metallic beasts that have been targeting guardsmen. Have you any comment about that?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">City Manager 's eyes darken.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: The metallic beasts, yes... now *that* is a puzzle. Someone has let loose something that they should not have, I'm afraid. Usurpers, probably. Short-sellers. Cretins! Does Dervin have some information? I will put the full power of the law behind him!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I doubt it, sir. House Mountriver is just as much a victim as any.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We would speak with Mister Vash next, if you aren't able to offer us any bette rleads.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: I will find these rats and squash them! I think they are hiding in the sewers. It's those bankers we ran out of town last year, I feel. They're hiding in the sewers.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Vash? Certainly he has nothing to do with this. It's his machines that are being slaughtered more often than not.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Bad for business!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hear hear.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: What is the connection with the current Berger war?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: If I'm honest, I think it's just a convenient distraction.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Quite right. Tell Dervin to just overpay for the lumber for another couple months, eventually Berger will cave.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We will take your counsel into consideration.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Please tell us more about these bankers in the sewer?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User is back. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: The bankers? Yes. They came here about a year ago, and immediately short-sold stocks like Middleworths, Pancha, and Build-rite. Laid what must have been a king's ransom against them! We wouldn't stand for it, of course. Caused quite a stir as you might imagine. We ran them out of town. But my guard captain tells me that there have been lights in the sewers reported by the staff. I'll bet a pretty penny they're back, looking to collect! Hah! Over my dead body!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Come to MY city and short sell all our stocks, will you? Hah!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: May they all rot in the sewers. We shall look into this and report to you and Durvin anything we find.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: We'll flush them out, hah! Have a drink, on me, and send one to Dervin! Don't forget to flush! HAH! HAHAH! Knurd, write that one down.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Frawd Knurd (rolling his eyes): Immediately, sir.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven laughs mightly</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you. We shall let you get back to your well deserved drink.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair probably spoils the moment.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Dare I ask about the Adventurer's Guild?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: The old guild, eh? Dervin interested in buying the land? 300 and not a penny less, I told him! Knew he'd come around.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair strokes his chin thoughtfully.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We'll remind him. We thank you for this audience, sir.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Any time, lads.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">City Manager returns to the roulette table.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (mutters conspiratorily): We ought to consider branding, if we're to continue consorting with business-minded people and city officials like this.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Frawd Knurd: Quite right. Boss'll be happy to trademark your outfit.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Hottery Inc.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: *hootery Inc</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Frawd Knurd (shrugging): Wouldn't have been my first choice.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I'm not sure about that one either Frawd.. We may have to get back to you.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We'll workshop it.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I say we stop beating around the bush and go through one of the cracks in the clocktower</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I'm tired of following red herrings</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sighs slightly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: One last chore.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair approaches the bar.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair hails the barman and signals Mendel to perch on his shoulder.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia follows Alastair to the bar</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven follows</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Barman nods to Alastair and the gang</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'd like to express my gratitude for your hospitality. It'd be unseemly to be ignorant of the 'damage' we are about to send to the house of our friend, if you would kindly settle the tab.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman: Of course, sirs. Let me see... *muttering calculations* That comes out to 1700 gold.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair dabs at his brow slightly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Once again, we thank you for your hospitality.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair picks up his shield and mace.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman: Shall I put it in the ledger?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: If you would.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman: I shall note it immediately.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Didn't the manager say he'd cover a round?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman: 1700 gold, to the Mountriver ledger!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: And one for Dervin!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Barman: I'll note that down as well.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (to the barman): Thank you</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Bows and calmly walks out. Wondering if a change of pants are in order.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair brings up the rear.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We better do something amazing or our life debt will have to be settled</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: and we may owe a life debt</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: So, to the cracks?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You emerge from the trapdoor into the bright light of midday.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We still have daylight yet to burn. And no shortage of mysteries... let's pray to our gods that we grip over some good fortune.</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alastair): *trip</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: agreed</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (mutters): Seventeen godsdamned platinum...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Your god? or Mine?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Anyone listening.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Your walk through the quiet streets of Clockport to the clocktower is uneventful. The large, round building is the tallest in the city and easy to navigate to. The hands of the clock face appear to be stopped. The building does not appear to be in great shape. There is a locked metal door at the rear end of the building.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (mutters): That's almost *two* whole resurrections...</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sits on the ground.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Take care while I'm out, all right?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sends Mendel up; he slumps where he sits.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven makes faces at Alastair</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel circles the building. There are no windows or other ways in our oyut besides a small door in the sheet metal behind the clock face. There is also the goblin-sized crack about half-way up the clock-tower from which Mendel had previously seen the creature emerge.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel perches where he can find purchase within the crack and stares in.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Mendel: [SKILL] Perception</font> [d20+1 = 19]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel carefully peeks around the lip of the curve behind the crack. It appears to be a room of some kind. The floor of the room is covered in what looks like small brass shavings. The door to the room is to the side and can only partially be seen. The door appears to have been mostly destroyed, and Mendel can see dark shapes occassionally flitting by. When they pass, Mendel can hear a clicking, buzzing sound.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel receives a signal to fly up to the top of the clock tower and perches in front of the rear door.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I'm not much for scaling. How about just breaking the lock open?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And fight our way up while they have the advantage?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I can *extends claws* but you should probably find some climbing gear if you want to go up.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven sighs</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: so be it</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven takes out climbers kit</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to Fenmia): It's up to you to forge the way. Mendel will keep a lookout for you.</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Alastair tries the door.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">It swings open. Within, there is a pulsing light eminating from higher up the clocktower. Through the pulsing, you see large gears and metal struts. Many of the gears are broken into chunks, and there are holes in the struts and platforms. Beetles cavort around the remaining machinery.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">An inch-thick carpet of brass shavings litter the floor.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks back with a face that says, &#34;Should I just close this door?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: hmm We should have perhaps persuaded the guards to come with us but no turning back now!</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Inside, you see that the light is eminating from a strange... TEAR in the space behind the clock-face.

Other times, a beetle appears out of thin air and flies. One appears and seems to fly directly at you!</font><br />

<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">About 30 seconds after he left, Mendel returns and attempts to relay what he has seen to Alastair. The air *was* wind. Wind, powerful, powerful wind everywhere. Mendel spent the entire time struggling to not be blown completely into the sky. He was able to position his wings at the right time to take a lucky surge of wind back into the return portal. What he saw was a grey world, peppered with thousands upon thousands of tunnel-like holes, craggy gray mountains, and a black sky. The wind was so strong that vision blurred while looking around, so he couldn't make out much more. No structures or creatures that he could identify, besides a couple fo the creatures flying out of the portal and flying downards towards the grey ground.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair attempts to recall his studies of other planes, trying to identify this place.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Shall we recover and then Talk with Vash?</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (looks at burned chest): Agreed. Maybe Vash would know more</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Maybe do some research on Tekavaris?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: oh and research on portals and who has the power to create them.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I can already think of one person... A certain wizard who was stuck as a statue?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks up at the tear.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I think we ought to alert the guard before we do aught else.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good Idea</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Is it possible that the creatures aren't attacking the guards directly but simply going for their half plate armor?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair thinks for a moment and looks about the area. Specifically for any traces of bats.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (absently): In all likelihood... Yes. That is most probable.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You wipe away a foot's worth of metal shavings. There's some old droppings visible below. But you see none on the top layer.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hmp. Well, its no moment. Hopefully there's a chemist about whom we may speak with... Shall we go?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia collects some metal shavings and puts them in a spare pouch</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: yes</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">You descend the way you came without incident.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I would like to go to the guards first. I want eyes on this tower</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I don't want anyone attacked while we are away</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Should we go back to that last place we were? We can speak directly to the city manager.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Can you have Mendel keep an eye on the cracks to make sure nothing comes out?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Sounds as good a place as any. Plus he's in good spitirs currently</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia winks</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: ***spirits</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Yes, for the good it will do.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel flies onto a rooftop to perch.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven (slapping knee in laughter) Spirits! That's a mighty good joke.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You head back to the Crowned Mole and find the city manager. He's now at the bar having a drink.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: You're back! Did you take care of that problem? Was it the short-sellers?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Afraid not, Your Honour.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Hmph. You may have been deceived! But is the problem taken care of?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I'm afraid it hasn't. My comrades here barely made it out alive. We have much research to do to fix the issue. You must know however, there is a portal in the clock tower that leads to another world. Through it comes those metal acid spitting monsters.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: The monsters seem to come out at night to collect as much metal as possible</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: that's why they attack guards. or at least that is my suspicion</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Egads! Sigh. I'll let the wizards know. Knurd, please zip over there at your earliest. Can't have wonton portals in the clocktower.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: Metal, you say? What do they want with it? We'd be happy to sell them some at a reasonable price!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We could not determine their language. I recomend an acid resistant trap set with metal to attract them.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: They take it back with them across the rift. The insides of the clock tower are in virtual tatters from them.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User is back. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager (face falling): That's...! That's very unfortunate! Our clocktower.... our pride and joy... We must avenge this invasion.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: also I highly reccomend a small but effective force of guards on lookout for the monsters. They come from the cracks in the tower.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager: We'll take your advice under consideration.... hmmmm</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you</font><br />
<font color="##000066">City Manager (to bartender): That's it for me, old friend. I must head back to the office.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">City Manager looks disgusted</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Sorry to be the bearers of such news.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: In the meantime we will continue our investigation and report our findings to you or a contact of your choosing</font><br />

<font color="##000066">City Manager: Remind me to give you our city brochure on serfdom. Very educational.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Shall we head to Vash's</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Let's. For all we know those creatures are all over him.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good point</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks down at his armour.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hmp.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I think I need to get a wooden or leather cuirass.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Don't you mean acid resistant wooden or leather cuirass?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You make your way through the afternoon light to Vash's building near the East Gate in Milkend. The building is rather well-kept and large compared to the ones around it. Various metal contraptions stand gleaming outside. There is black smoke coming from the chimney. The building itself says LIBRARY in large stone letters and through the windows you spot rows of bookshelves.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: How in the world is the metal still out here?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Further investigation is required.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair increases his pace briskly.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair enters.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven enters the store</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia follows</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (hushed): I think he may be in league with the creatures</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Inside, you see that this is a library or bookstore, or at least it used to be. Beyond the first two rows of books is a metal chimney rising fromt he floor and going into the ceiling. There is a young man sitting behind the counter, legs up on another chair, poring over a book.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven nods at Fenmia</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (loud enough to be definitely heard): Good afternoon.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The man looks up from his book,a nd speaks in a deep, precise voice: &#34;Greetings. Welcome to Vash's Foundry. Are you here for the books or to place an order for an automoton? Currently, automotons are on a six-month backlog, I apologise.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair shakes his head.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Other reasons, my good...?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair says, leading toward an introduction.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash (extending hand): Vash Brightly, at your service.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Other reasons. Well, that sounds exciting. Please elaborate.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia starts browsing the books</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The books cover a range of topics -- they seem particularly esoteric, bordering on useless. Many are theoretical books about other planes, but appear to not take themselves very seriously. Many are about whacky-sounding conspiracies.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: (Shaking Vash's hand) Wonderful to meet you! I am Alieos Belgiven. On my right is Alastair. And the Tebaxi over there is Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia picks up the first conspiracy book he finds and starts thumbing through it.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">He has a very strong grip. Very strong.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Well met.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven matches his grip</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Vash's grip is too strong.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: You are quite strong. My goodness!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia finds a book titled &#34;Dwarves: Were they imported from overseas?&#34; that tries to make the case that Dwarves are actually not sentient and are actually &#34;puppets&#34; controlled by a powerful entity. The author submits as evidence their stature, which he insists is round and sturdy to hide the mechanisms, and the beards act as a sort of psychic receptor.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash (falsely modest): Ah. What you refer to is the result of my smithing.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The back of the book recommends the authors next title: &#34;Embrace the Orb: A Story of How To Overcome Flat THinking&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Ah. Well good on you. Looks like I need to start smithing...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Have you heard anything about these mechanical creatures that are attacking guards and your automitons.</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): ? not .</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Yes, I have heard about those problems.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: From what I hear you are the local expert on automitons. These creatures are more like semi or fully inteligent automitons than flesh and blood creatures. We wanted your opinion and help with them.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I would be glad to assist. Do you have a sample?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Hands over the vial of acid and the signal box.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We also have a whoile creature</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Vash ducks behind the desk and emerges with a pair of large gloves.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash puts on the gloves, then gingerly accepts the samples.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good idea. That vile has some nasty acid within</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Would you like to join me in the smithy? I call it a lab, as it is more than a simple smithy.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven points to Alastair's armor</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: See what it can do?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Sure!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash (looking at the armor): I see the telltales of acid. An extremely strong type.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Vash leads you to the center of the building, where there is a metal stairway leading down. He beckons you to follow and descends.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Would that I thought to carry a pouch of something alkaline on me at the time.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair follows.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven follows, determined to get to the bottom of this one way or another</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia noticing the group dissapearing down the stairs hurridly follows</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (over his shoulder): Find anything of interest?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Oh, yeah!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Several twists of the spiral stair later, you emerge into a large cavern. There is a large chimney that leads back up, and many large, silver tubes connected to the chimney. The tubes lead to an array of what look like complex forges. Brass is littered everywhere in various stages of assembly. Many tables line the walls with small buckets of gears and eyepieces hanging from pegs.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I would ask you to not touch any of the equipmnent. It is often extremely hot to the touch, and may burn you.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash steps over to a table filled with glass and chemicals and begins doing Science on the acid.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (showing book): I guess dwarves are really puppets!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: ...I suppose it would explain how they can live off of ethanol.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash (looking up from his work): Ah, I see you have found the tome by Voggner. In my opinion he does not make as compelling a case as he did in Embracing The Orb.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: It may be some time until we can get results from your samples. You are welcome to return another day.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Truthfully, that isn't our only business with you, Mr. Brightly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We will also attempt to send over a corpse of one of these</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I see. Please elaborate.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Several twists of the spiral stair later, you emerge into a large cavern. There is a large chimney that leads back up, and many large, silver tubes connected to the chimney.

<font color="##261A12">Your eyes momentarily glaze over as you flash back to Mendel's report....</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">About 30 seconds after he left, Mendel returns and attempts to relay what he has seen to Alastair. The air *was* wind. Wind, powerful, powerful wind everywhere. Mendel spent the entire time struggling to not be blown completely into the sky. He was able to position his wings at the right time to take a lucky surge of wind back into the return portal. What he saw was a grey world, peppered with thousands upon thousands of tunnel-like holes, craggy gray mountains, and a black sky. The wind was so strong that vision blurred while looking around, so he couldn't make out much more. No structures or creatures that he could identify, besides a couple fo the creatures flying out of the portal and flying downards towards the grey ground.&#10;Alastair attempts to recall his studies of other planes, trying to identify this place.&#10;Alastair describes to the party what Mendel saw.&#10;Alastair: Don't suppose either of you could know of such a realm?&#10;Fenmia (looks uneasy): I'm not really that kind of monk...&#10;Alastair: [d4 = 3]&#10;Alastair: [SKILL] Arcana [PROF] [ +3] [d20+7 = 10]&#10;Alieos Belgiven: hmmm I don't recall such a place.&#10;(Alastair): Burning two Inspiration.&#10;(Alastair): for rerol&#10;Alastair: [SKILL] Arcana [PROF] [ +3] [d20+7 = 18]&#10;You recall a single word from some strange tome that you thought irrelevant: Tekavaris&#10;Alastair shakes his head.&#10;Alastair: I think we've learned as much as we can here without further endangering ourselves.&#10;Alieos Belgiven: Agreed.&#10;Alieos Belgiven: Shall we recover and then Talk with Vash?&#10;Fenmia (looks at burned chest): Agreed. Maybe Vash would know more&#10;Alieos Belgiven: Maybe do some research on Tekavaris?&#10;Alieos Belgiven: oh and research on portals and who has the power to create them.&#10;Alieos Belgiven: I can already think of one person... A certain wizard who was stuck as a statue?&#10;Alastair looks up at the tear.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Your eyes unglaze.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Does the word &#34;Tekavaris&#34; mean anything to you?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash drops the vial of acid he's holding, as well as the catalyst he was slowly pouring into the vial. A small fire erupts on the work table.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Damn!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash runs over to a lever near the chimney and prepares to pull it.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair takes a step back for his own safety.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair also raises his shield, ie &#34;takes the Dodge action&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia dashes to the stairs</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Does nothing</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash pulls the lever and immediately the sound of grinding metal pierces your ears. Several blocky, janky clockwork machines rise from their places around the lab and begin to plod towards you. Vash looks confused.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: This isn't what I programmed...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">One of the machines stops 20 feet from Vash and fires a spray of fire into his face.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Vash!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: !!!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Stop drop, and roll, man!</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven Knocks his head back and spits at the machine. In mid air the spit morphs into acid, hitting the machine.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: unfortunatly, the machines doesn't seem to care or be effected by it.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Vash walks back to the table and mutters some words under his breath and points at the machine.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The machine stops immediately, and its torso lowers as if it is bowing.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Well, thank goodness for that.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Thank you for your help. It is regretable that one was destroyed. I understand that it was unavoidable.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Now, tell me, what do you know of the Tekavaris?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash 's eyes widen uncharacteristically as he awaits your response.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: First things first, Mr. Brightly.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (calls over to Alieos): Get over here, I'm channeling.</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alastair): +5 HP to Alieos &#38; Vash.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Thank you. Now, the Tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: It was something that came to mind as I was racking my brain trying to recall if I could remember anything about that plane that my familiar was sent.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: The same place that was the origin of those metal outsiders.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash (closing his eyes): I knew it. I simply could not believe it. I have been searching for so long.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Where is the portal?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: At the top of the clock tower. Hopefully it's being secured by the city guard right this moment.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Excellent. Thank you. Do you seek a reward? I shall grant you anything within my power. Ask quickly, now. I must first check the programming of my creations, then begin final preparations.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Vash, you're going into the portal? Alone?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Not alone. I will bring my army.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: ...The ubers?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash sweeps his hand around</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: The.... Ubers.... yes. All my creations are fitted with combat gearboxes. As you have learned too well.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm. But will they not be taken apart by the outsiders? Surely they're formidable, but the outsiders have flight and a taste for metal.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: There are limits to their power. Once I manage to make a foothold in their realm, create a workshop there, I can build from the very stuff of creation. Fight fire with fire, as some say.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair nods, understanding.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Very good.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: You are formidable warriors. You are welcome to join me. I shall raise you to the rank of General in my army.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair is taken slightly aback.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: Crowned Mole</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Consider us your mercenaries for the time being. As for a reward, would you kindly see to it that our expense to House Mountriver is forgiven at the Crowned Mole, we would be very grateful.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (adds): And a non-reactive cuirass. My armour has already been compromised by the outsiders.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair knocks his chest.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I will address the debt. The cuirass... I would make it myself but I will be occupied for some time. Perhaps I can give you the gold you need to purchase one. I am uncertain how to make it non-reactive easily. I would need to analyze what's left of the acid. Again, I will not have the time.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Very well. Shall we rendez-vous at the tower while you muster your troops?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I need several days to prepare. Perhaps I can pay you, as mercenaries, to investigate the bad actors who tampered with my creations. It is vital we do not have any similar mishaps when we take the fight to the Tekavaris.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (strokes his chin): I think we may have a lead, actually...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Do you have any enemies?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Or frenemies?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Tell me where you reside and I will send any information I glean from the disabled machine once I have it.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We are currently the guests of House Mountriver. You may find us at the estate.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (coughing): Hopefully.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I have many enemies in this town. As you are surely aware by now, the politics here are rife with what these peasants see as intrigue.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash spits the word &#34;peasants&#34; with distate and a frown.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Then it is settled. There is a safe with the money you need over there.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash points to a safe tucked away in a corner.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Anyone you know with the knowldge to reprogram your bots?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Thank you once more and I look forward to the upcoming battle.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Agreed</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: I do not wish to make guesses without more information.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I appreciate the sentiment.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We will not act rashly nor prematurely.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair makes a glance at Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: If that will be all, I have much to do.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Of course. If you will excuse us.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven: grumbles</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: So then, back to the Mountriver estate?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: A rest would be nice, aye. But I wonder if we should continue with this momentum that we've built.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: As long as we don't run into any more... machines</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Continue where? I can't think of any leads unless you feel like attacking the Burges.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Bankers in the sewer? More probably mages, I think.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: oh yes.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Very well</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Right. Maybe just a short rest then?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And I still have business with the Adventurers' Guild. They ought to be notified of the outsiders.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: A short rest it is.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair helps himself to the safe first, though.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Inside is a pretty vast sum of money.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sighs slightly and looks for platinum.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: There is some platinum, but there is also several gold bars and promissory notes.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">There is some platinum, but there is also several gold bars and promissory notes.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair withdraws 15 platinum with quaking fingers.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair hurriedly puts them into a purse and ties the purse around Mendel's neck before abruptly dismissing him into his pocket dimension.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Vash looks up briefly, then looks back down.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I will be sure to log our expenses for your review.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Vash: Do not bother. The cartels they call businesses around here love to shovel gold into my coffers in exchange for trinkets. I need only enough to fund my war effort, though that is a considerable sum. Based on the scale reading, the amount you have removed from the safe, you can keep.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We are grateful.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to the rest): Gentlemen?</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: Kanly</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you. Shall we leave?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia nods</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You make your way back to the Mountriver estate. As you cross the main thoroughfare that runs throught the center of the town, you can see in the distance that some seige weaponry is being positioned near the clocktower and many guards are milling about the area.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Vash: Party taking short rest.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: The manager is rather apt at... managing.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair spends his time assessing the damage to his armour, examining the damaged breastplate on a table.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The armor has large holes in the chest area, the most important part of the armor's protection. There are many small indentations left over from where the acid splashed into it. The sigil of Tor is still recognizable, however.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair frowns.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'm afraid I'll have to retire this piece for now.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to the others): I should like to go on a shopping trip later today if there is time.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [DEATH]</font> [d20 = 3]<br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia finds a quiet corner and begins humming a tune to himself</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [RECOVERY]</font> [d8 = 6]<br />
<font color="##660066">Recovery [6][HD-1] -&#62; [to Alieos Belgiven] [STATUS: Wounded]</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: [RECOVERY]</font> [d8+1 = 9]<br />
<font color="##660066">Recovery [9][HD-1] -&#62; [to Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alieos Belgiven (Patches): himself up</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven patches himself up</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: we might have enough money after we pay our debt.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm, I think it may be too late to troll a sewer. Could we check in on the Guild?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: .. Does the time of day matter when in a sewer?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I was thinking more of us. We've had a rather busy day already.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I'm good to go whereever</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ah. very well. we can go to the adventurers guild or go shopping.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia throws a few quick jabs at the air</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Since Alastair wanted to go to the adventurers guild let us go there first.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We may be able to find some clues as to who in particular was targeting our new client.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Sounds good</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You check in at the manor briefly but the checkpoint is gone. While there is still more guards patrolling than there were two days ago, in general everyone looks more lax. There is still a giant crossbow being pointed from the roof, however. You are told that Dervin is not currently in the house, though you are welcome to make yourself at home.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: </font> [13 = 13]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: (Owl noises.)</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair raises his hand to hail a Mountriver bannerman.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Was the lumber dispute settled?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bannerman (shrugging): Ya know how it is. Holg accidentally discharged his crossbow around lunchtime while trying to win some bet, and the bolt sailed clean over the Berger estate and struck a lady doin' the wash. Guard was called, the usual rabble from the council stepped in to have a talk and it was agreed to take it down to a Level 2 alert. So's technically we're still at war but I'll be damned if anything'll come of it.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair spreads his hands.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Game's still afoot.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Bannerman: All's I know, they're payin' war rates, so...</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair gives a small salute as he goes on his way.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (absently): They sure do love their kanly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You walk the Old District of Clockport. It is filled with a very different kind of construction than Milkend was. Where that was chaos, this is order. Where that was slapdash, this is neo-Dwarven engineering and money. Finally, you arrive at the location of the Adventurer's Guild, a building that stands out mainly due to disrepair. It is a large stone, square structure with carvings of dwarven heroes that have been worn down over time. What looks to be a training yard now lies mostly empty. The great double door is locked beneath the guild's motto, in Dwarven: &#34;We chase the dragon.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair approaches the front door.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair peers about and thumps his gauntleted fist against the door to knock.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">There is a long silence in the quiet neighborhood.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair tries the door anyway with a shrug.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Maybe we should just go in</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The door swings open with a creak. It's completely dark inside.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair casts light on his shield and points it at their surroundings.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You see a stone hall with a weathered, tattered journal attached to a chain next to the entrance. Several doors pepper the hall.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair flips to the latest entry.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The book is hard to read and the pages are tattered but the latest entry is fairly fresh. It reads in Common: &#34;Vash Brightly has arrived, seeking to slay the greatest dragon of them all: Time itself.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">It is dated almost a year ago.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair reads that line out loud.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Sounds ominous.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks about for the bulletin board.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You spot the bulletin board hung on a wall above the book. It was hidden from view from the outside!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">There are several scrolls attached to the board, but none are legible any more except one: It looks quite old, but still legible: &#34;Notice to all members: Meet Sunday night downstairs for final closing ceremony. Thanks for all the stories!&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sighs.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And that's that.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks about the hall again, trying to take in the history.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Why'd they close down?</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (hesitantly): Also, do you think we did the right thing helping Vash?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Saving his life or agreeing to helping him?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We saved a man who by all evidence at the time was innocent. I regret nothing. If he turns out to be evil, he will perish. and his army</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: I think we had to save his life... But telling him where the portal was. If he's trying to &#34;conquer time&#34; then doesn't that give him a lot of power?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Maybe too much power?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: The man may be a genius, but I wouldn't give him too much credit.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: In the very least he may be able to protect this town from threat of encroachment from a hostile extraplanar force.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: You're probably right. It's jsut something about him that rubs me wrong</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I... agree. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me so much if the man himself was also some sort of autonomaton or artificial creature.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair raises a finger.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: ...Or a time traveller. Also possible.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Fenmia (pauses): I hadn't even considered that</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Not *probable*, mind you.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Hm. I came here wanting to post a request. But now...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I wonder if we could request of the City Manager if we could set up shop here.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: If we *should*, rather. I wonder if the old guildmaster is still in town working a new trade.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair looks around, searching for a plaque or otherwise that lists the guild's membership.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: It would be nice to have a place to call home, so to speak.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We wouldn't even need to brand. It'd be more like... assuming management.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Behind the desk, you find a stone with the words &#34;Sorren Bergerson, Guildmaster&#34;</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair grunts slightly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Looks like we'll be wanting to know those truce words after all.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: ...Or have our Lone Wolf set us up with a tete-a-tete.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair turns to the other two.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I think I've seen all that I need to. Unless you want to see if the basement has any leftovers for us.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia looks to Alieos</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: What do ya think?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I say we leave.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia nods</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Shopping?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: All right. I'm still not fighting fit until I find a replacement for my breastplate, if we could find an armourer.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Tally Ho!</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [EFFECT] AC: 3 [UNITS HR]</font> [ = 8]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [EFFECT] AC: 3 [UNITS HR]</font> [ = 8]<br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair asks an armourer if they're familiar with a &#34;linothorax&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] History [PROF] [ +2]</font> [d20+6 = 8]<br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sighs and then explains that he wants a breastplate, only he wants the front to be enameled.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair thinks harder and makes one last attempt: he asks if there are any alchemists about.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: Alastair spends 2 Artha</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SKILL] History [PROF] [ +2]</font> [d20+6 = 13]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair eventually finds an armorsmith who's heard of linothorax armor. The smith explains that her father used to make some occassionally back when metal was scarce. She doesn't really know a lot about it, but believes she can replace the breastplate of your armor with such a piece and at least partially get the armor back to working condition.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">GM: 16/18 AC</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The process will take a day. She is prepared to put her other orders aside for the day since yours would be the most expensive order she currently has.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Five hundred on delivery, yes?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Smith: Half now ifya please.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Very well.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair summons Mendel.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia asks around looking for a pan flute, brewer's supplies and a pound of flour</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair grunts slightly.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Just show some restraint, please.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Will do</font><br />
<font color="##005500"> (Alastair): Alastair is spending 500 GP</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia asks Alastair for the 17 gp to buy his supplies</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven asks Alastair for 4cp and 12 gp</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Shall we check in with the guards at the clock tower?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'd like to see if anything has changed, aye.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia nods</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia (nods): Let's go</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You walk over to the town square, your packs now somewhat heavier. There are three portable seige engines deployed with their load of explosive aimed at the clocktower. A military-style tent has been erected a hundred or so feet away from the tower, beyond which is a zone cleared of pedestrians.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'm glad to see that they're taking this seriously.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Indeed.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Anyone see the head of the guard?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You spot two men arguing inside the tent. At least one of them appears to be in charge.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ah, There he is</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Before we do anything hasty, wait a moment.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Very Well</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sends Mendel.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel perches atop one of the tent poles. The following conversation is heard:</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Big Brass: Well, as you well know, I have a responsibility to the people!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Big Money: You don't have the authority unless the council declares a state of emergency!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair repeats the conversation verbatim as it happens in real time, having warged into Mendel and trying his best to capture the cadence and nuances of the arguing voices.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Big Brass: That's only to fire upon those on the outside. I know the law!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Big Money: We can have a court martial decide on the legality of your actions should you order your men to fire. Consider that.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Big Brass: Court martials be damned! These pests have been terrorizing the city for weeks!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Big Money shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Big Money: Do what you will, then. But I tell you again: Important people are asking you to delay.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Big Brass waves his hand dismissevely.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Big Money exits the tent, shaking his head in frustration.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Looks like our moment to step in.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair wargs out of Mendel.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ready?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair blinks, reorienting himself.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I am now, yes.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel keeps watching the area from his perch.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Mendel: (Owl noises.)</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven walks up to the guards outside the tent.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Guards: Halt. If you're here to see Command, he's busy.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you. I imagine he is. Please inform him that a group of adventurers who have defeated two of these beasts are at his service if he would have need of us.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair pokes Alieos with a Guidance.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="##660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Persuasion [ +2]</font> [d20+5 = 12]<br />
<font color="##660066">Guards: </font> [d20 = 14]<br />
<font color="##880000">Guards attempt to butt you with the blunt end of their spear.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Guards: +3</font> [d20+3 = 4]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: That was rude.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Guards trip over their own spear.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Looks like he needs all the help he can get...</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Guards: Drat. Get out of here! We're busy. Don't make me throw you in the stocks.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Guards dusts himself off</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">You wander into a nearby pub when Alastair overhears one of them singing a well-known Berger anthem. There is about two dozen dwarves in the place, and a few representatives of other races. There is a large oxhead carving dominating the bar, and a semi-circle surrounding two dwarves who aren't singing but rather drinking from enormous ewers. The rest of the crowd is singing and cheering them on.</font><br />

<font color="##000000">Alastair (of the ox): Hmp. Let's hope the barmaid will utter the name of this place when we're asked for our orders.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair presses on.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I doubt that would work. He's brought so much prosperity. I was hoping you would have been able to provide some insight into his character. He's clearly determined. And brilliant.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: And with no shortage of enemies.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: He's both of those things. I do wonder how he got the money for his ventures. And the materials, for that matter. He has been extremely driven to some end, and given what you're telling me, it might be related to this invasion.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: I've gotten the impression that he is a good man, but one who cannot see past his goals to &#34;why&#34; deep inside the soul. I went adventurin' to see the world, but eventually realized that I really wanted to settle down and have a family. That's the kind of thinking that Vash isn't old enough to do, yet.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Given his brains and talent, I wonder if it's a deadly combination.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair ruminates on Sorren's words for a moment.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I don't suppose the word &#34;Tekavaris&#34; means anything to you?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Not in the slightest.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Would've been too much to hope.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We have a potential lead on those who wish Brightly ill. I think it was some rivals hiding out in the sewers?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: In this city, everyone is an enemy. There's been rumors of someone hiding in the sewers, but I assumed they were nonsense. What makes you think they're accurate?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We were heavily encouraged by his honour the city manager to investigate.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Pfft. That's not evidence. Everyone around here is suspicious of everyone else. If you're in politics, sometimes it's convenient to be suspicious of an outside enemy so that you don't anger anyone.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Vash has got enemies, sure. But it could be anyone. I can think of any number of folks who'd be annoyed at him.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: What evidence *do* you have?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Malfunctioning automatons that turned against him in his own laboratory.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Unless that may just have been a clever ruse by Vash?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Looked pretty real to me</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Nah, he's not the rusing kind. So that's pretty strong evidence that whoever this particular enemy is, they're almost as smart as Vash if they can trick the machines he made.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Does Vash have any such rivals? I was under the impression that he had the monopoly on innovation in this town.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: He doesn't, exactly. If it was me investigatin', I might have a chat with the Mage's guild. They're kind of universally disliked in Clockport, but they were a necessary evil to send messages quickly, set up defences, and generally look up information. But a lot of Vash's machines have been tramplin' a need for 'em. And they're mighty smart, might be that they could make a machine malfunction.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (to no one in particular): Another push in their direction.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Sorren: Party taking short rest.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: actually, we did hear something about rouge mages in the sewer</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Maybe the mages will know something</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I'm hoping we can see them on their street level offices first before fishing in a latrine.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven luaghs</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: yes</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Before we overstay ourselves here, Guildmaster... what would it take to reinstate the guild?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Well, as to that.... it was initially disbanded by city charter some 20 years ago. I was replaced as guildmaster by an upstart who decided to turn the place into a cult to some insane god. As you can imagine, things went a little sour. The city had to shut the whole thing down after the blood sacrifices were uncovered. I suppose the first step to getting it back up and running would be to convince the city to roll back that charter.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair strokes his chin.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Bood sacrifices? Do you know which god they were worshipping?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Oh-ho.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: I shan't say his name. He's known as The Taskmaster.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Do you rememebr the name of the upstart? This could be related</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ah</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: The upstart was named Pikke, but he's not the problem.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="##660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Religion [PROF]</font> [d20+1 = 3]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Hmm... Taskmaster.... Taskmaster... Nope, can't remember where I've heard that.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia shakes head</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair stifles a snort, but not because of Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: He's a powerful god. Don't dwell upon him too long. Dwarven god. Old. Exiled.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Lives far below ground. Below even the fair dwarf gods.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Name starts with an L.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: His followers rarely see sunshine. This cult was an exception. Really, they weren't true followers. Just kids on the wrong path, playing with power they did not understand.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: A bit random but have you heard of kuberlorg?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Hmm, I see. Thank you</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I ask because I suspect he has a hand in this</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Ah, now that's an ancient name. I have indeed. Is he not the forefather of several of the most powerful clans in Clockport? He is most ancient.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Last I recall, he is no friend of the gods at all.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: really? hmmm then perhaps he can be an ally</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I think we've already fallen a bit out of his good graces...</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren: Hah! That'd be the day. Khubrorlug is probably a million miles away playing chess with demi-gods.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The bartender and Sorren both share a long, hearty laugh.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: eh, he's down a few days ride in a montain frozen in stone</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Acually, last we checked he had freed himself</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Sorren and the Bartneder are incredulous at you mentioning you have seen the wizard. They seem perturbed by the news and their laughter fades. After ensuring you are telling the truth, they both make execuses about having to be somewhere and prepare to leave the bar.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (of the two leaving): That bodes ill.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: hmmm I should really watch my mouth</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Well, Wizards tower?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair makes a face.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Haven't we done enough meddling and inquiring today?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Yeah, I need to tend these wounds anyways</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: It's kind of our thing.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair assesses his spell slots.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: I won't argue that point, but our resources are dwindling. So long as we don't go spelunking for mad mages I suppose it can be done.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Fenmia: Well, I will follow your lead</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair slides off his stool to stand and retrieves his shield with a sigh.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia bows and gestures ahead</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alieos Belgiven gets up and leaves</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair shoots a small salute to the room as he makes for the door.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Been a pleasure, Bannermen of the Bergers.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Sorren (grunts): Be well, and stay safe.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Bartender nods to you</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">As you leave the Ox, night has truly fallen. The city seems as somber as usual tonight. You quickly learn the location of the Mage's Tower is on the eastern side of The Barrow, to which there is a small underground passage. Having not been to the Barrow in your trip to Clockport so far, you are surprised to see the difference in atmosphere from the city proper. The buildings have been rapidly constructed, often with visible holes between joints, and often haphazardly atop one another. Cheap cloth is used as an insulator. There are some folk who move in the shadows but your general appearance protects you from harm... for now. You eventually find the mages, though it is difficult because there is no tower. Instead, a green pavillion sits on the edge of the Barrow with several desks outside with bored-looking wizards manning them.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: Welcome to the Mage Tower. How can we be of service?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: Oh, and do you have an appointment?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair takes in the scenery first.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (distantly): No, apologies.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: yes, and no</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Though the environs are shabby, the smells here are much more interesting than inner Clockport. The smells of many home-cooked meals waft together. You spot also several strange-looking wooden scaffolds that crawl up the side of the Clockport wall. You see shadows moving up and down the scaffoldds.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair snaps out of his reverie.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: Forgive us. We are adventurers and wished to inquire about your order and how it serves this city.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The wizard stares at you for a full second.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: Do. You. Have. An appointment?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: no. we. do. not. have. an. appointment. can. we. make. an. appointment.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: please.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: we. would. apreciate. it</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: Yes, fill out form A-114. Unless you plan to attend a tour, in which case form A-117. If you plan to enter as a party of three, you will additionally need form W-1040EZ.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Wizard gestures at a stack of forms to his right</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair winces.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alastair: We *really* shouldn't have gone to the Ox before here.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: Wait times are currently 0 minutes and 0 seconds.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: What form do we have to fill out to inquire about rouge wizards in sewers? Or about summoning beings from other dmentions to attack the city?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: Sir, there's no need for that tone of voice. I just work here. I cannot let you in without a form, and neither of the things you are asking about have relevant forms.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Other Wizard: Actually, Robert, form X-109 is for filing an extradimensional attack alert.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Wizard closes his eyes as if mustering patience</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Wizard: I know that, WILLIAM, but that is not what the man said.</font><br />
<font color="##000000">Alastair (mutters to Alieos and Fenmia): While you deal with this, I'll perform a ritual to help us...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Close enough</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thanks!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair excuses himself to cast Unseen Servant.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Other Wizard smirks at Wizard</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We'll fill those forms out post haste. And I'm glad we can talk as gentlmen now</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The wizards ignore you and continue to argue about forms. Any attempt to speak with the wizards without giving them a form gets you a piercing look and a threat of Color Spray being cast in your direction.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Alastair: [SAVE] Constitution</font> [d20+2 = 14]<br />
<font color="##660066">GM: </font> [d6 = 3]<br />
<font color="##880000">Mendel falls off of Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Fenmia bored of the wizards squabbling, sits down, takes a pinch of the red powder and eats it.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">You learn that there's actually a pretty intriguing system to the forms. You manage to piece together the intent of the number/letter scheme and feel confident that if forced to argue with the wizards about forms, you can probably outwit them.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Alastair sticks a provided quill into a seemingly empty space and it stays. With a fatalistic sigh he and the floating pen begin signing and initialing where is required of them, filling out the forms.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">The unseen servant finishes penning the forms. The quill is dropped with an almost aggressive disdain, uncharacteristic for the spell. The form floats over to Alastair and slams down on the ground in front of him.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (of the... outburst): Huh.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I think you broke him</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair stoops to recover the stack.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Bureaucracy will do that.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair scoops up the forms and shakes his aching wrist. He then takes the completed papers to the desk.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Gentlemen.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven walks over with Alastair</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Wizard takes the stack of papers and gingerly sets them down. He puts on some glasses, slowly, and begins to leaf through the papers.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven sighs</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia, having tasted of the red powder from his box, enters a trance-like state. The red powder tastes like cinnamon. Fenmia's vision goes black and he finds himself standing on a mountaintop. The platform he is standing on is circular and about 30 feet in diameter. There is a small wall sticking out of one end of the circular platform but it is otherwise easy to fall hundreds of feet into jagged rocks. The wall has a weapons rack hanging from it with a wide array of weapons.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Wizard: Well, this appears to be in order. Please enter within. Since you do not have an appointment, you will may be seated in the waiting room. The clerk will let you know when it is your turn for audience.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thanks.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven: enters and sits</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Other Wizard grabs Alieos's arm as he walks by. &#34;Beware, do not anger the council. They are quick to anger.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia examines the weapons looking for the &#34;coolest&#34; looking weapon.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Inside the pavilion, you behold a much larger space than the pavilion could possibly hold. Of course. The floor is littered with paper, but the place is ominously quiet and mostly empty. There is a small row of chairs to your right, and a desk with a clerk in front of the chairs. You see no one else.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alieos Belgiven (surprised): Why thank you for the advice without the beauocricy</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair lingers thoughtfully at the reception desk.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven bows and enters</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): I didn't mean the why</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): I meant to thank him</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">When Fenmia begins searching for the coolest weapon, exactly what he is picturing when the search begins is right there on the weapon rack.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to Wizard B): Since we will be detained further, may I inquire about the procedure to apply to the guild?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia picks up the chain blades and begins to have a sick training montague.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Wait till they hear about this...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Other Wizard: I believe that would be Form X-998. If you are applying on behalf of a relative, Form X-999. You must hire a local artist to pain your portrait as part of your application. The portrait must follow guild rules, which are explained on form X-991.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (nodding): You have my thanks, the forms will be submitted sometime within the next four to six weeks.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair helps himself to forms X-998 and X-991.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Depending on how large of a dose Fenmia took, the vision eventually fades. Fenmia feels that if he and someone else consumed the powders at the same time, they could duel.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair glances back at the zoned-out Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: All right then?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (shaking head clear): Wow, these powders are awesome! Oh hey Alastair!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well, we're moving along inside now. You can take another sniff if it seems we'll be waiting for another while.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair follows in after Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia nods and follows</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You sit down. After some time, you inquire about the wait time. The clerk says that the wait time is 0 minutes. After asking why you haven't been shown in yet, if the wait time is so short, you are told that you must take a number to be eligible for audience. You are given a piece of paper with the number &#34;1&#34; written on it. As soon as you take the paper, the clerk yells out &#34;ONE! NUMBER ONE IS UP!!! ONE!&#34; and ushers you forward to the center of the large space.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair is too engrossed with his application form to be perturbed.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Enters</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair passes his shield to his Unseen Servant with the command to &#34;watch his things&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair follows.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Once you get to the center of the emptyy space, the pavilion room slowly fades away around you, only to be replaced by red curtains around you, and a double door behind you. In front of you are nine desks, of which five have important-looking wizards sitting at them.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: What is the nature of your request?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Bows to each wizard respectfully</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: It is an honor to meet with you all. We have multiple inquires pertaining to your guild. It's current functions, its history, and involment in current events. Also, we have come to warn you of impending doom and ask your assistance in dealing with said doom.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you in advance for gracing us with your presense</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair punctuates Alieos' sentiments with a militaristic salute.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wizards narrow their eyebrows as they gauge your level of respect....</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair Guidances himself.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [SAVE] Charisma</font> [d20+2 = 9]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Performance [ADV] [DROPPED 2]</font> [g20+3 = 14]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Performance [ +3]</font> [d20+3 = 9]<br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Aleios spends 1 Artha for Advantage</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair spends 1 Artha for advantage</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Performance [ +3]</font> [d20+3 = 4]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sweats, knowing that he blew it.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Alastair actually spent a total of 3 Artha for advantage AND a reroll. To no effect, sadly.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Sweats knowing his friends blew it</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Current respect level: -1. If the party ends their conversation with negative respect, you have a feeling the wizards will Punish you. If you end with 0, you will not be punished, but neither will the Wizards want to help you. The higher the respect at the end, the more likely they are to be friendly now and in the future.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Alastair actually spent TWO Artha. Ugh.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Let us begin then with your first inquiry. It's current functions are the maintenance of the city of Clockport, the assignment of Wizards as personal guards, and the assistance in research for many of the city's fine businesses.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: History is unimportant. Ask the clerk for a pamphlet or something. Ugh.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: That takes care of your second inquiry. As for the third, we must request clarification. To what current events do you refer?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair raises a hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: If I may, sir.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: It is outlined on Form X-109. An interdimensional incursion.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: One that may have been prematurely escalated.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Yes. You refer to the Pandemonium Portal.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important looks at you expectantly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Ah, so you know if it. Good. If I may, was this of your doing? Does Vash have any part in this? Or perhaps the rouge wizards we have heard about?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: If you'll pardon me saying so, young man, you do rather presume that we can converse as equals upon this matter. May you present your credentials please?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair gives Mendel the command to perch on Alieos' shoulder to deliver a Guidance for his inevitable next CHA skill check.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important (arching an eyebrow): Is that a familiar? Why an owl?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (in hushed tone): do we have credentials?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alieos Belgiven (With strained frustration): Equals in what? I bet I can sing and dance better than any of you. I once danced for a demon to communicated with it. It was moved. What credentials do you wish to see?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (also in a hushed tone): Whatever you had when we first met, if any at all...</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />

<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven uses prestigigitation to animate the meeting with the demon and Alieos's dance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wizards talk amongst themselves briefly. Clearly one is very against whatever Alieos said, while another is very much FOR. &#34;He said he danced for a DEMON? What more needs be said?&#34; can be heard.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Current respect level: 0</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Well, we were hoping for a relevant degree, but my colleagues have agreed that a performance of the dance you performed for this demon will suffice.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wizards look at Alieos expectantly.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair pumps another Guidance into Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 1]<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Respect level: 1</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): last two rolls were tests</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Alieos takes a deep breath. He fills his lungs with the air he smelt that day underground with the demon as his companions cowered around the corner. He smells the dirt and mossy rock. He feels the rage of the trapped demon in his heart. Then, begins to dance. His body bends and arcs in devilish beauty. He replicates his dance perfectly. According to the demon this was an ancient demonic form of comunication known only by a few demons. Its beauty, if seen by lesser men could drive them into madness. To the wizards, it is just a wonderious dance that communicates the words I spoke to the demon.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wizards look on patiently. One sits with arms crossed and eyes in the air, petulant. Another claps along with the performance and giggles at opportune moments. &#34;Intriguing. Very well. Perhaps our appreciation of dance as a power usable by those magically inclined was.... incorrect. Clearly you are adept in this, and we can speak as equals. What of your friends? Are they worthy of having discussions about the fate of our world without melting into a goo?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven bows as an equal</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I am most pleased you enjoyed my performance. My friends here are more than capable. They have stunned me many a time.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Are they masters of dance as well? Are you a troupe of dancing wizards? Show your credentials!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Oh... Umm... Well, I don't think I can dance quite like Alieos... But I do have this</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia shows the symbol of Helm brooch</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: You jest mighty wizard. No, we are not a troup. We are adventurers, helping out to all of good nature, and we are seekers of knowledge. Fenmia here has a remarkable method of fighting. It is a dance, though he may not see it that way. It is wonderous and dangerious. Alastair is wise beyond even me.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Also, if you want to see wonderous things... I have this</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: And they can both take on a tavern full of well seasoned dwarves. I can tell you that</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia pulls out box of powders</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (recoiling): Helm! We are followers of the mighty Azuth here. Do you challenge us to a magic duel? Helm would lose!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: The powders.... what of them? One of Helm's treats?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (throwing up hands): I do not wish to fight you... Merely to show you where I come from. The powders are tests, of sorts.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Tests? We love tests.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Yes, let's do a test.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: What kind fo test?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (mutters): Them's fightin' words...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important (singing): Teeeeest!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (presenting box): One of you may choose a test. I will not tell you what the test is and we will take it together. To see if we are indeed &#34;equals&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wizard's eyes narrow.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia make quote gesture when saying &#34;equals&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Well, if you aren't up to it... That is okay. Another day perhaps..</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia goes to put box away</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Nononononono.... Oh, we're up to it! Which of us do you challenge?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Pick me!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">All the wizards speak at once, offering reasons why they should be picked for the test.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: If I may make a suggestion?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Oh. Please</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: I suppose you may, though I will remind you that you have not produced any credentials as of yet.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: We leave both the challenge and the challenger to chance. Let the dice decide.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alastair): so roll a d6 for the powder and a d10 for the wizard?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />

<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: You bring some strange customs into our Tower of Power. Playing gambling games to determine credentials! Well, why not? Any of us would topple your compatriot at any test! Roll your bones, then. Get on with it!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: There are other petitioners waiting, we haven't all day!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Wizard's Respect Level: 2</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: That may be true, but none of them will be as interesting as us.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia smirks</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sighs slightly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I'm afraid I have erred, and that we must needs improvise. If you would allow me, good magi?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair waits for dissent.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Whatever gets us to the test! Be quick, now!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sends Mendel away to bring the Unseen Servant to them, and meanwhile removes his helmet.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to Alieos): If you would kindly?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven hands over paper and quill</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair begins to literally draw up lot one to nine and tears the paper as needed, sprinkling the bits into his inveted helmet.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards (whispering): Is the.... is the test still happening?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (whispering): Yes, yes! Soon! It's happening! A test!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair Mendel returns with the shield-toting invisble Unseen Servant and perches on Alieos' shoulder.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And now for the challenger. My invisible, impartial friend will draw the lot.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d10 = 10]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d10 = 8]<br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: Hah! I win!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And now... our challenge.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (muttering): Rigged!</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d6 = 1]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Present the powder box, please.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia presents the box</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: Wait, how do we know you didn't select the test that I'm worst at?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia takes a pinch of red powder and gives it to the winner</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: It's not like the number you have drawn from the... device.... matches a label or something.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: I didn't choose the test, fate chose for us</font><br />
<font color="#880000">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards takes the powder.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia explains the 1 is top left, 2 is top middle, etc.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: Fine! Let's do the test.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia also takes the powder</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: See you on the other side</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Your vision fades to black and you appear atop the mountaintop yet again.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: Well, this is just a simple Mordy's Mental Translation spell in powder form! And, what, now we have a magic duel up here? We couldn't have done this in the pavilion?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to the remaining council): We alas lack means to view the process and outcome of the contest. Unless one of the most esteemed council may scry upon the contestants?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Why of course! We must witness the test!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Important Looking Wizard waves his hands and casts Scry</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Important Looking Wizard also casts Projection</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The image of the mountaintop is now projected on the red curtain</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (gesturing to the rack of weapons): Perhaps, but this so much better! I mean just look at the view! So, if you please, choose your weapon.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: Weapon? Hah! I have need of nothing but my mind! Select your fiercest metal bludgeon.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Hah! She is correct, the mind is much stronger than any weapon! Hah!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards: Walks over to one side of the Arena and gets into magic duel stance</font><br />
<font color="#880000">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards Walks over to one side of the Arena and gets into magic duel stance</font><br />

<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Fine. Next, you with the owl! Credentials!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair whistles a silent tune as he tries to stitch the pieces of torn up paper together again with Mending.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair gives start after a moment, realizing that the fight is already over.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">One of the Other Important Looking Wizards dusts herself off and whistles as she returns to her desk.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia looks very pleased with himself</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (coughs): My apologies.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to Fenmia): Well done.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Well done Fenmia!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (gives a thumbs up, nods and says in a semi-hushed tone): Thanks guys. Honestly, I expected more from them. I guess fancy chambers don't account for everything.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (with a grunt): I express gratitude toward the kind words of my comrades, however I admit myself to be somewhat... repulsed by self-aggrandizing, sir. If it pleases the council, the armour I wear belonged once to the monks of Balesha, a holy artefact of a hero of their order. We received it as compensation for assisting in freeing the monastery of a curse inflicted by a banshee.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Prior to that we had entered into a brief... venture with the famed archmagus Khubrorlug. Our presence here and the words of our current benefactor Dervin of House Mountriver may corroborate our deeds.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: I've been to Balesha! I see through your lie, blackguard! Your armor is a forgery, and a bad one, as it has a hole in it where Kashmyr's had none!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: The breastplate was damaged fighting off the outsiders that come from the Pandaemonium Portal. You must know that they specifically target metal.</font><br />

<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Well, this is true. Indeed, it does appear that the hole shows the telltale signs of Tekavaris acid.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Normally we would be against such things but considering all else we've dealt with this evening.... please do.</font><br />

<font color="#000066">Some Other Wizard Who Also Looks Important: Truly wonderful! It's like I'm in the rolling hills of Balesha once again.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Very well. You have all proven your competence. Let us discuss the portal, then.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: You ask for our assistance. Well, you have it. We have been trying to close that portal for some time now! However, our efforts have been stymied. Just recently, we plotted a gambit we felt sure would succeeed.... but earlier today, the trigger went off but somehow the plan did not work! It's been quite frustrating.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Trigger? Did the trigger occur sometime in the afternoon? Vash's automotons suddenly came to life and attacked all of us. We had to put them down.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Ah! You foiled our plans! Did you come here to taunt us?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: We defended ourselves, sir. We came hoping to find insight into our own assailants and motive to a potential murder. But now we realize that when it comes to the safety of Clockport, it is not so cut and dry.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And by 'Clockport' I do mean the Prime Material itself.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Is the portal growing?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Yes, it is growing. And it won't stop until someone stops that madman you were defending!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Let us hypothesize what would happen if your plot succeeded: Vash is dead. What next? We were under no insinuations that he was either the cause of nor directly assisting in the Portal's growth.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: He is most certainly the cause of the portal. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the Tekavaris. We ourselves did not know about them until the portal started to appear and we sent several spells through. We discovered ancient texts that helped us understand the threat. You see, the Tekavaris are a defense system for the universe itself. They are mindless, and operate on a fundamental level. Portals to their home, Pandemonium, appear whenever there is too much mechanical ingenuity! Too much brass! Too much automation, and steam! The Tekavaris hate steampunk. Have you never wondered why our world has remained at our current technology level for tens of thousands of years? The Tekavaris are the answer!</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Vash, the madman, is purposely trying to get us all killed! He must be stopped!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair is aghast.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: The only defense is... becoming luddites?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (waving a hand dismissively): Well, we always have magic.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Is not much of Vash's technology still derived from the arcane?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: No, his creations are purely mechanical! Sometimes they may operate magical tools and instruments, but at their core they are naught but metal and a power source.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Can there not be a co-existance if we can manage a way to close the portal and keep future portals from their world closed? Also, I think Vash is just an inginious and determined man. If he learned this was his fault I suspect he would try to invent something to help eveyone not kill them.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair clenches a fist.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Why not just tell the city about what Vash is doing?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to Alieos' point): I think he knows.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (to Fenmia): We tried! They have fallen in love with his machines. They cannot see reason. We considered simply blasting him to smithereens, but it would not stop his machines and hence do nothing about the portal -- all while making the town turn on us. No, the town will be of no help here. You must stop Vash.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (to Aleios): Earlier today I would have said such a thing is impossible. But you have shown us that there are ways of looking at the world that we haven't considered. Too much time around narrow-minded thinkers, I suppose. Perhaps it is possible. We will help if we can, but we do not know how to accomplish such a thing.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Who would?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Maybe in one of his books... He did have a lot</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Many of which of spurious quality.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Who would? No idea. Isn't that your job?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: A job implies payment</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to the council): Vash intends on engaging the Tekavaris on the other side. He is preparing an invasion force. I daresay that he will be well-prepared for the operation, though  I have no basis for comparison.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (to Fenmia): We'll be happy to pay you a very sizable fee to eliminate Vash.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to Fenmia's point): Although a favour may serve just as well as a means of incentivizing us.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard (to Alastair): Madness! But perhaps useful madness. All we need do is destroy the clocktower after he is inside the portal. That should eliminate enough steampunk to close the portal.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: What is your true goal. The portal or Vash?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: If one must be prioritized.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (mutters): I admit that the idea had struck me...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: The portal! Even if Vash succeeded in his invasion, the Tekavaris might just flee through the portal into our plane!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: This is much to ponder. If we are to continue to coordinate with the Mages Guild and the city guard, do we report to the council directly or is there a liason we may communicate with?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: We will give you a ring of sending. It is paired with our offices. You can use it to send messages to us.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The wizards produce such a ring.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: What do you plan to do next, then?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Actually, there was a matter that I wished to bring before the council. May we have your endorsement to reinstate the Adventurer's Guild?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Somehow, I think that's a bad idea, but I don't remember why! How odd. Well, if I don't remember then it's probably fine. Consider yourself endorsed.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (bows): We thank you. We will contact you tomorrow when we have rested and composed ourselves. I for my part may be suffering from a concussion.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Mendel: *concussed owl noises*</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Important Looking Wizard: Of course. Please fill out form S-25. If you have any reason not to mark five out of five stars on the parchment, please let us know. We make our living off of satisfied customers like YOU! </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Yes, I am near death myself</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">With that, the wizards, curtains, and door all fade back to the large pavilion</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair blinks hard.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I didn't just hallucinate all that, did I?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: If you did, I did.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Wizard Clerk (to herself): Halluciantions: Form H-102.... I think we're out of those...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ha!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair helps himself to an S-25.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: We should make our way back and rest up now, yeah?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (nods): Hopefully the kanly has started to settle down for the night.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Form S-25 in Aleios's hand asks you to rate your experience with the council on a scale of 1-5 inkblots, with 1 inkblot being the worse possible experience and 5 inkblots being the best. There is also room to elaborate on your choice of inkblots.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair ponders for a moment.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven 5 ink blots</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (sighs somewhat exhasperatedly): Just give them the five and add something shallow and pithy.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: done</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: A+++++ would council again</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven hands form over</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: please can we rest now?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair hands his shield over to the Unseen Servant again, too weary to equip it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The evening is uneventful, luckily. You all head to bed without incident.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">..........................................................................................</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">You find yourselves suddenly in a small room with a black and white tile floor, a low ceiling, flanked by statues of Dwarves in the corners. There appear to be no exits.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">You find yourselves suddenly in a small room with a black and white tile floor, a low ceiling, flanked by statues of Dwarves in the corners. There appear to be no exits.&#10;Mendel is nowhere to be seen.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: This isn't the usual dream..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I'm not the pinching type, so would one of you kindly?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia whipsers Where are we?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven slaps Alastair</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair rubs his cheek.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (flatly): I guess you aren't the type either.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Oh sorry. No, I don't pinch</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">One of the dwarf statues in the corner near you begins to speak.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: SILENCE.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair frowns in response.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Wondering if poo came out.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (begins): walking towards the statue that spok</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair rolls a hand as if prompting the statue to continue speaking.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Nothing happens.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair slumps.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven: Shouting I'm saying nothing!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia reaches out to touch the speaking statue</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alieos Belgiven (Shouting): I'm saying nothing!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The dwarf narrows his eyes.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: What part of SILENCE do you not understand? The wizard will be with you soon.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Oh sorry. But he could be on time if he's going to summon us.. No?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair meanwhile attempts to recall any semaphore knowledge from his studies.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Pffft. The wizard cannot know when you choose to go to sleep.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair has clearly overcommitted to the bit.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven: Looks at Alastair and starts blinking his eyes. -..-- ....-.- -- ---- -.---</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (clearing throat): Umm, excuse me Mr. statue... Which wizard?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: I will give you three guesses.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Dop we get anything?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: for guewssing right</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: My respect.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Koborlug</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: That's not how you pronounce it, you're missing an 'H&#34;. But correct in essence.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: It's more of a--</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: The great. The mighty! The once trapped in stone wizard that own a being called mountain destroyer!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair [Dwarvish]: [Translation] Khubrorlug.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Khubrorlug.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alastair]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: oh thank you</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf (jerking his thumb towards Alistair): Yeah, like he said.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Cool. I didn't think we saw the last of him.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I hope he liked his book</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: He was riveted to the core and has spoke of nothing else since.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Oh good! We wanted to make it up to him for not slaying the demon.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: I was joking. I have no idea what book you're talking about.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Just killing time.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: awww man..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Don't suppose *you* are also an indentured spirit inside there.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: My teeth are fine and I prefer to be referred to as a demon. What of it?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Koborlug</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Alieos Belgiven: Koborlug</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Koborlug</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Koborlug</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): Forget the last 4 messages</font><br />
<font color="#000066"> (Alieos Belgiven): Forget the last 4 messages</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: And that one</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: So what exactly does a demon get from being summoned into a statue?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">GM: Nothing. The motherhexer trapped me in here. *shrugs* Happens.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Nothing. The motherhexer trapped me in here. *shrugs* Happens.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Are you the only demon or are the rest of the statues demons as well?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: They're demons too. Old Khuby's got quite a collection, you know.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Hey guys! Hows it hanging?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (shakes head): This is awful... Is there a way to set you free?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to himself): Hm, I suppose Devils would be more difficult to bind.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf 2 [Infernal]: [Translation] Greetings.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Greetings.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Infernal]: [Translation] Greetings!</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Greetings!</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Yes. You'd need to find the totem that binds me in Khubrorlug's palace.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: And snap it in half!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Infernal]: [Translation] Sure, no problem. We freed one, we can free you others. But we'll need to collect a rare book for each of you. You wouldn't happen to know where we can find some rare books?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Sure, no problem. We freed one, we can free you others. But we'll need to collect a rare book for each of you. You wouldn't happen to know where we can find some rare books?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: How will I know when I find it?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I'll switch back to common</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Common]: I asked were we can find some rare books. We will need one for each demon</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alastair, Alieos Belgiven, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: If it facilitates communciation.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: It is a small statue the size of your fist, bright green, shaped like a toad. It'll have a magical aura.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Would doing this come with a boon?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf 2 [Infernal]: [Translation] Will not work.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Will not work.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Well, I highly doubt you will succeed. Many have faced off against Khubrorlug and I haven't seen much of 'em since. But if you were to free me, I will happily grant you any boon within my power. If you manage to find other totems, I suspect you will get similar offers from the others.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven [Infernal]: [Translation] Oh, well then. We will have to become more powerful to be able to stand up to him.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Oh, well then. We will have to become more powerful to be able to stand up to him.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair makes a face.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf 2 [Infernal]: [Translation] May work.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">May work.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Sounds like something I read about in Ravencroft.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alastair): *Ravenloft.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Seriously, who sommons three people and doesn't show for this long?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf (ckocking an eyebrow): Is that the one written by that Shaharazade person?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Well, it's like I said before, he didn't really summon you so much as cage your spirits while he's busy. He wishes to speak with you. But he did not know when you would go to sleep. So he cast a net that would capture your spirits as you were going to sleep. He will be along soon enough.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Oh</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Unless he gets distracted, in which case I'm to send you back in six hours.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: How considerate.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Arathis save me..</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (nods): I will find them and free you... But... You know... When we are awake again</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf (to Fenmia): Hm. Do you swear this?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I shall help free you as well</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: So... is what we are seeing and experiencing just a translation for our spirits to interpret or literally a physical room somewhere?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (points): That one over there slapped me earlier.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alieos Belgiven (Looks): behind himself</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven looks behind himself</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: I swear it</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: It is a physical room in Khubrorlug's palace. But these are not your physical selves, just your spirit. Khubrorlug's spell has given your spirits shape that mirrors many properties of your physical appearance.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (somewhat disappointed): Ah.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair tries to will his fist to become an owlbear head anyway.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf (to Fenmia): Then good luck, Tabaxi. You must find your way to Khubrorlug's palace and have a way of avoiding his security systems.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven sits down and starts meditating</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair plants a foot against a wall and attempts to walk up it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Security systems?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: If its anything like his hut... I think we'll be alright.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Insight</font> [d20+2 = 21]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair is able to will his spirit self's local gravity to rotate 90 degrees. He is now standing on the wall.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Huh. Never seen no one do *that*.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (mutters): Still no owlbear, though...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf (to Fenmia): I don't really know all the details, unfortunately. He doesn't tell me that kinda thing. But you know how wizards get, especially lonely ones like Khubby. Lots of paranoia.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair paces about the wall with his hands folded behind him.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Wouldn't be surprised if he was in his &#34;need to attain immortality&#34; phase.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia looks at Alastair slightly confused</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair tries his luck on the ceiling.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair finds he is able to manipulate his local gravity at will.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven: attempts to float in mid air while seated</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair looks &#34;down&#34; at Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Insight</font> [d20+3 = 13]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I wouldn't doubt that this would be strange to one of your... ethnic group.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Aleios manages the trick as well and floats into the air, lowering the strength of his local gravity.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sits crosslegged on the ceiling and begins to ponder.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair attemps to phase a hand through the ceiling.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Insight</font> [d20+2 = 18]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair figures out how to channel his Guidance power into his spirit form.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 4]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Insight [ +4]</font> [d20+6 = 24]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven attempts to change his outward appearence to match Koborug</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair's hand phases through the ceiling. </font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Insight</font> [d20+3 = 23]<br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (of his hand): ... No. Yes?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Aleios's appearance suddenly morphs to be a picture-perfect replica of Khubrorlug.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Well, that's just weird. I don't like it.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair frowns at &#34;Khubrorlug&#34;. Still not an owlbear.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven: looks for hidden door ways or openings</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well. Time to take this to its natural conclusion.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair stands up then attempts to &#34;dive&#34; into the ceiling.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Perception</font> [d20+3 = 8]<br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Alieos, looking around for secret  areas, touches a stange metal plate attached to one wall and gets a sudden &#34;</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos, looking around for secret  areas, touches a stange metal plate attached to one wall and gets a sudden &#34;shock&#34; that reverberates through his &#34;body.&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Dwarf: </font> [1d6+1 = 6]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Oof!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Khubrorlug's (well, Aleios's) body falls to the ground.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair passes through about half a foot of solid rock before emerging into a small wooden storeroom of some kind. There are old carpets, mirrors, and furniture all around. You find as you get further from the room, it becomes harder to stay.... corporeal.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SAVE] Constitution</font> [d20+2 = 13]<br />
<font color="#261A12">There is no ill effect but you feel it would become increasingly difficult to get further.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Damn. So much for doing recon.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair floats back down through the floor with a grumble.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): we'll get 'em next time</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Did I miss something?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Umm, well </font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Alieos kind of started touching things and then fell over</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: I figure he's probably alright because everyone knows if you die in a dream then you're fine in real life, right?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Let's not take any chances...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair pokes Alieos with a Cure Wounds.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Insight [ +3]</font> [d20+5 = 9]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair's spell fizzles. It seems that he is unable to get the proxy Aleios to &#34;act&#34; as the real one for the purposes of the spell.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Hm...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: One more try and then it's up to our host.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair grumbles.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Heal [1] -&#62; [to Alieos Belgiven]</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [DEATH] [CRITICAL SUCCESS]</font> [d20 = 20]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: ug</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair gives start.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: That didn't feel good</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Oh.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Careful with that wall</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: See Alastair? He's fine. No need to worry</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Dwarf: Well that's good, 'cause I didn't want to be the one to tell the Tabaxi the bad news....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I suspect he is testing us</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And *I* suspect that we're below his notice for the time being.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair glances about the small room.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: If you can come up with a way for us to take advanage of that without dying, let me know</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: If you would kindly relate how you got yourself into that state I will.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I was looking for openings in the walls when I touched a hidden metal play right there</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven points</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The room is largely featureless. The four dwarf columns in the corners are the only feature of interest.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Hopefully it's the only one.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I doubt it</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Now...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair spies the north wall.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: As good as any.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair attempts to stride through it.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (Holythesea)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair passes through the north wall and finds himself in an oval chamber made fo granite. On the floor are pools of caked blood. There are glass partitions on one side of the room showing a dark hallway beyond. There is a locked gate seperating the grantie oval room from the hallway. On the other end of the oval room there is a strange looking pile of dark ooze.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair does that Homer Simpson &#34;nope&#34; walk through the hedge.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Um, right. Let's try West next...</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">To the west, Alastair enters a dark space. Every couple of seconds, some type of lightning seems to flare in the distant parts of the room, lighting it up for a brief moment. It seems that the room is covered in small metal barbs, with lightning occassionally surging between them. You see an occassional small 2-foot-high shadow moving between the metal barbs.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair abruptly takes a step back into the &#34;waiting room&#34;.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Any volunteers for the next one?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair offers his hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Sure, why not</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven takes his hand</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: South.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair takes a step  into the wall.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">The two of you pass through the south wall into a vat of water. Through the sides of the vat, you see many other glass cisterns in this dark chamber, with various lengths of metal piping leading from them and going into the walls and ceiling. You don't have long to observe tihs as water begins to rush down your throat....</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SAVE] Dexterity</font> [d20 = 1]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [CHECK] Dexterity</font> [d20+1 = 8]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Both of you immediately begin to drown.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Dwarf: </font> [1d4+1 = 3]<br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair desparately tries to recall that he doesn't need to breathe.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair does not let go of Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Khubrorlug's body chokes and begins to float upwards through the water.</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Insight [ +4]</font> [d20+6 = 13]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alistair manages to convince his proxy body of what his brain already knows.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">He no longer needs to breathe in this form.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Godsdammit...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven I'm not dead</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair is not privy to Alieos' internal monologue.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair drags himself and Alieos back from where they came.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You emerge, soaking wet, back in the dwarf room.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (Vzaretskiy)</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair grunts.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I'm still getting the hang of our... predicament.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair crouches and gives Alieos CPR.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): back</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">Alistair stabalizes Khubrorlug. Aleios. Whatever.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sighs slightly that he managed to stabilized Alieos, but then frowns again, unsure if he can pull off a heal to get him back up.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair closes his eyes and puts his hands together in prayer--he channels divinity, or at least tries to.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 1]<br />

<font color="#261A12">Alastair manages to work around his inability to cast Cure Light Wounds by appealing to the divine energy from his deity. There is some complex deitomatics in play, but Alastair figures it out and gets it to work.</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alastair): 5 HP to both Fenmia and Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Ouch.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Okay</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I have an idea</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Nothing can harm me. Nothing can harm me. Nothing can harm me.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven Tries to convince himself that in this form he is unkillable</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair crosses his arms.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well... it is technically true.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Unfortunately, death is a law of ther universe that always holds -- even in spirit form.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair holds a hand out for Fenmia.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: All for one?</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alastair): Would you do it for a... doobie snack?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (takes Alastairs hand): Doobie doo</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair looks to Alieos.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Round two?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Can you bring me back again?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I mean if I fall?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sweats.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Just keep up that positive thinking from earlier.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: eh</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: okay</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: How are you walking through walls?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Lets go</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Like I said. Positive thinking.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair takes a step toward the east.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User has gone AFK. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Could we positively think ourselves awake?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: That's a good point</font><br />
<font color="#660066">User is back. (gaerlan)</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You pass through the east wall. There you see a low-veilinged chamber lined with metal. In the center is a large rectangular desk upon which sits several magical tomes, and a number of strange magical apparati. Magic runes and sigils glow on the floor and on the surface of the desk. There is parchment scattered in one corner, and a small statue of a dwarf sitting at one end of the room, opposite the desk and near the door. Khubrorlug stands with his back to you, standing over the desk, reading from one of the tomes.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair signs to the other two to the effect, &#34;Do we snoop? Do we go back?&#34;</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia not moving, looks around for the totem described earlier</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Fenmia spends 1 Artha for Advantage</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Fenmia: [SKILL] Perception [PROF] [ADV] [DROPPED 9]</font> [g20+2 = 17]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia spots the totem standing next to several other, similar-looking animal totems on a shelf underneath the desk, next to Khubrorlug's left hand.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia gestures to the others towards the totem</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven nods. Aims an eldrich blast at all the totems and fires.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia stares wide-eyed</font><br />

<font color="#660066">Alieos Belgiven: [SKILL] Insight [ADV] [DROPPED 2]</font> [g20+3 = 18]<br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos's spell rips through the totems beneath the desk, obliterating them. A great rumbling passes through the structure as Khubrorlug whirls to face you. Upon spotting Alastair and Fenmia his expression of surprise turns to a scowl, but upon seeing... himself! -- A look of fear flashes across his face and he makes a rapid movement of his hands and disappears in a puff of acrid smoke. The building continues to rumbvle around you.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: This may have been the worst best thing you've ever done.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">A small, snake-like being suddenly crashes through the wall next to you and roars.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">It's scales are dark-hued and seem to be vreflective like water.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Beautiful..</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Wait! Don't attack! We freed you!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Might wanna drop the act now, Alieos.</font><br />

<font color="#261A12">You awaken in your room as normal.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">GM: Party taking long rest.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sits up in his bed and counts his teeth with the tip of his tongue...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven moans awake</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven looks down and notices that he hadn't wet the bed</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Fyew! I figured, Drowning dream ending in an explosion...</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair sighs and rises, stretches, then kneels on the floor, beginning his morning prayers for spells.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: So, uhhh any way to contact kuberloug?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: I think he'll contact us... He's probably pretty upset we blew up his study</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And if he does, it may be smarter to disavow.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I'd likle to know what he wanted to talk to us about</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: we could aklways ask delvin</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We also need to continue down the math the mages sent us</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Remind me.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: So... We need to handle the vash situation. I'm not a fan of killing Vash yet. I think he means well. We need a way to spead Vash's tech out farther and close the portal</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I'm pretty sure that &#34;where&#34; isn't an issue. So long as there is Vash-tech on the plane, the Tekavaris will appear to devour it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I'm wondering if there is a third path to consider... One that is neither technological nor arcane.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I'm wondering if there are any artificers in this town. Or if perhaps the old guildmaster would be able to point the way.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: The Wizards seem a bit too conservative to consider for this, I think.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: How would artificers help?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Yeah, what's your plan?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I want to see if one of their constructs would be able to enter the portal with no ill effects and if they'd be ignored by the Tekavaris. As they're more arcane in nature than purely technological, that may make them undesirable or ignorable targets.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: They don't ignore organics</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: like us</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Then again... I suppose a Druid may also fit the bill.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well, we were hostile and they act defensively.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Suffice to say, this is a delicate operation already with many moving parts... And we have a want for allies and resources.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Honestly I was hoping we could speed along the reformation of the Adventurers' Guild to gain some easy allies and in-roads to more expertise and supplies.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: I wonder.... What if vash worked with the mages/artificers to automate the process of removing his bot's battery and replacing it with a magical power source? would that fix this?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: I agree, reforming the guild would certainly help us gain allies. We might also be able to cut out a little section to have as our own</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair makes a face as though he has an idea.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair stands up.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Mayhap we should check up on our patron.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: agreed. it has been quite some time since we last saw him</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: Lets</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: But first.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair rings a bell.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Your favorite manservant shows up after a full two minutes of silence.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Manservant: Good morning.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Good morning. Would you kindly spare a paige? We've another productive day about town.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Manservant: Of course. Do you have the message ready?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Ah, forgive me. I require assistance with my armour.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Manservant: How can a paige help with your armor?</font><br />
<font color="#660066">'Vzaretskiy' disconnected</font><br />
<font color="#660066">'Vzaretskiy' connected</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Strap it onto me, as he did yesterday.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Manservant: One will be along shortly.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Eventually, a servant comes by to help Alastair into his armor.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Right. Thank you. How goes the kanly?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Paige: We're at about a Level 4 now, so things aren't quite as bad. Besides, the council has demanded all major jouses prepare for an assault on the clocktower, so attention has been on that anyway.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Hm. Is Master Delvin in? I think we should probably have a few words with our host regarding his participation in our little war with the beyond...</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Paige: After asking around, the staff says you are welcome to speak with Delvin at your convenience. He is in his warroom.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">After asking around, the staff says you are welcome to speak with Delvin at your convenience. He is in his warroom.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (to the others): Vash first?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (nods): Yes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Is there a reason not to see Delvin first? So we don't go back and forth?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: He seems to be the most pressing matter at the moment.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I don't really think we have anything to relate to Delvin that the city manager wouldn't have already since he's mustering the houses to the defense of the town.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We can ask Delvin to send a message to Kuberloug</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: As you wish.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Let's go!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You head to the warroom, where you spoke with Delvin once before. You find him there now with a stack of paperwork on his planning table, and three of his commanders in conversation around him. The doors are invitingly open so it does not appear Delvin fears intrusion. When he sees you enter, he smiles and welcomes you to grab a drink and asks how your stay in Clockport has been so far.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven smiles broadly</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Delvin! Oh yes, wonderious sights! The other wordly portal bringing about the apocalypse was scary.. Seeing kuberloug again. Oh that Vash guy</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair nods stoically.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (ambiguously): Your fair city is ever a font of interest.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven picks up drink and toasts</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia picks up a drink and joins in the toast</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: To fighting for the future. For our honors. To friends.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: Sounds... eventful! Yes, quite eventful. I'll drink to that, yes!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Delvin raises his own glass.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (takes): a glass and raises it as well.</font><br />

<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven drinks</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia drinks</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): and to the adventure we share</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair drinks</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Delvin drinks</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Now, if you have the time, I'd like to talk about your possible roll in helping save Clockport (and probably the world) and the profit in doing so.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: You have my ear, friend.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: So, this city is under attack from metal spiders from another demention. They will destroy us all.....</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: So, all our lives are at stake</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: So the question is, how do you, Delvin Mountainriver, want to come out of this fight? How about Savior of Clockport. Imagine how much your name would be sung. Your power and wealth would explode! All you have to do is help keep this city safe for now.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair surreptitiously prods Alieos with a Guidance for the inevitable CHA skill check.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 3]<br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: Lad, that's precisely what I plan to do, along with the other houses. And the city guard, besides. We're going to strike at the clocktower tomorrow morning! You already told the city manager all this, so no nede ot convince me!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: You mean to destroy the tower? I don't think that will stop the attacks... There would just be another portal</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (to group): right?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair nods.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: That is my understanding.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: yep</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: Well, the city council seems to believe that if nothing is done about the invasion, we'll all be sitting ducks. They're rather face the enemy-head on. Vash has assured us late last night that he will rig our siege hardware to aim and fire by itself and will be providing an invasion force to attack the portal.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: We are saying that though defense is the right thing to do an offence into the portal or attempting to destroy it before we know how to close it properly would be regretable a move I think</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: Well, you're speaking with the wrong person, then. This is all above my paygrade. I just want to go back to doin' business and guarding my profits from those Bergers.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: Even if I don't show up tomorrow morning, the rest of the houses will be. Do you expect us to look like cowards?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: No, but isn't there another option? What if all the houses agree to only defend and not attack? What if the houses agreed to help organize the people for when the big invasion comes? So people have a plan and places to evacuate to.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: I'm sold! Like I said, I just want to get back to doing business.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Even if it means walking back the adoption of Vash's technological marvels?</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: I don't understand the connection. You're saying that I should not assault the portal. I assume you are going to take care of closing it, then? What does this have to do with Vash?</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair waves a hand.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I mispoke. Please ignore it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: In fact we were just about to see the man himself.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Delvin Delvin scratches his beard.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Thank you for your time Delvin.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven bows</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Delvin: Losing those machines.... that's a scary proposition. We've come to rely on them quite significantly. I hope you don't do anything rash.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair glances at Alieos, then Fenmia, then back to Delvin.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I assure you that we act with Clockport's best interests in mind.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: And will do so with great consideration.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Fenmia plays his pan flute while the group travels</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alieos Belgiven dances and sings along</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You head over to Vash's workshop. The streets are lit by the morning sun, putting the city in a new light. The streets seem to have even more automatons than usual, many of them hauling scraps of metal and wood, carrying soldiers, sheets of metal, and some broken down in the middle of the street. Before you even get to the workshop, you encounter Vash standing over one such &#34;wreck&#34; speaking with a gaggle of young scholarly-looking types, a mix of humans and gnomes. They all are holding sheets of parchment with complex-looking diagrams and metal toolboxes sit by their side.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (of the sight): Hm. So he has assistants after all.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (muttering to the others): What are we calling ourselves? We haven't decided on any sort of party name yet have we?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: We haven't... Any ideas?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good point</font><br />
<font color="#005500"> (Alieos Belgiven): Fox Force Five!</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well... we aren't a guild. And there are only three of us.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Fenmia: The Three Amigos?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: A guild needs founders with a great history of adventures. We a starting that story. So just name the guild now</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Good on..... What's an amigos?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (shrugs): Not sure, I just like how it sounds.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: Even better!</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair raises a brow.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: So that's it, then?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (exaggeratedly): Ah-Mee-Goes</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alieos Belgiven: sounds ominous</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Alastair (agonizes): internally about having to take up the guitar.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Well, I suppose it is. Come along then, *amigos*.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Alastair approaches Vash and co.</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Vash looks up and nods to you, then goes back to explaining some concept about repairing machines to the young students he is speaking to.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia [Gnomish] (to Gnomes): [Translation] Excuse us, we have business with Vash</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Excuse us, we have business with Vash</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="#880000">Gnomes sheepishly mummble some apologies and bow to Fenmia akwardly and step away. Vash looks mildly annoyed but turns to you expectantly.</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia [Gnomish] (as they walk away): [Translation] We'll be but a moment</font><br />
<font color="#000000">We'll be but a moment</font><br />
<font color="#660066">[understood by: Alastair, Fenmia]</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: You are interrupting my instruction to my new students. This slows down the war effort. What have you come to relay, Fenmia?</font><br />
<font color="#000000">Fenmia (clearing throat): Sorry to intrude. Destroying the tower isn't going to stop the attacks. What is your plan?</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I sincerely hope you've conceived a means of controlling or at least stabilizing the portal before any living thing attempts to enter it from our side again.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: With due respect.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: I am equipping my creations with the ability to fly. We need to be able to send massive amounts of forces through the portal. For that to happen, the tower must be destroyed. Thank you for preparing the city council for this use of their equipment.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash (to Alastair): Elaborate on what you mean by stabilization. I sent a drone several hours ago but it didn't make it. I planned to send a small swarm next, possibly through the main entrance.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Hm, I was hoping that with some intense examinations of the portal we may find a way to limit its size. Perhaps by constructing a frame around the anomaly and a way to contain it.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: To that end I would like to request a fresh construct with flight abilities. One that has not yet been activated so that I may make my modifications to it.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: Granted. Feel free to take any of the unprogrammed spares from the shop.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I thank you. Have we access to your library as well? Better yet, one of your students. I wouldn't dare dream to distract you from current operations, but the timetable has moved up and I wish to complete my little project ahead of the assault.</font><br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: </font> [d4 = 2]<br />
<font color="#660066">Alastair: [SKILL] Persuasion [ADV] [ +2] [DROPPED 8]</font> [g20+3 = 14]<br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: You can use my library. However, I have few enough students as it is. I may let you borrow one if you explain your idea to me, and how it will improve the war effort.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Very well. I wish to construct a &#34;smart&#34; drone. One that would be better equipped to evade the detection of the Tekavaris, or at least better to relay information from Pandaemonium. For that I would need to... mix our methods.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: I propose to summon my familiar into one of your constructs and then fly it through the portal, maintaining the connection for as long as possible.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: With onboard instruments and whatever suite of tools you have equipped, we should have a better understanding and a higher rate of success than any of those unreturned automatons that you've previously sent.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: Mendel has already returned from the other side once.</font><br />
<font color="#000066">Vash: Intriguing. The ability to scout would, indeed, help the war effort significantly. You can have Lucci.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">One of the gnomes looks from Vash to you, then shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">Alastair: You have our thanks.</font><br />
<font color="#261A12">You head to Vash's workshop.</font><br />
